&+WWhat are Mana Points?
&+b---------------------

Mana points are they way the MUD deals with the magic spells
that you use. It used to be that whenever you used the fireball,
frost, etc spell, it would drain your health. Now, with the mana
system, your mana points are drained instead of your health. Mana 
points heal the same way that health points do, sitting makes them 
come back faster.
