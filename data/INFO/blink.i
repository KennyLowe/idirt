&+b-------------
&+wBlinking text is fairly easy to do, the codes are as follow:

    & B : Blink On (No space)
    & * : Blink Off (No space; ie: Reset colors)	

&+WNOTE: &+wFor those of you that don't like to see blinking 
      characters, you can type NOBLINK to turn blinking
      off, just type NOBLINK again to view blinking
      characters again.
