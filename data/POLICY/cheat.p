&+WCheating Policy
&+b---------------
&+WMortals:
&*  Do not accept weapons or armor from Wizards if you know that it doesn't 
  belong in a certain zone. If you are not sure, let a power know what the 
  item is and they will check. 

  Do not steal items from other players, this is a no-no.
  
&+WWizards:
&*  Do not clone any weapons, armor, food, etc for mortals. If you try to do
  this, something very bad may happen.

  Do not summon weapons, armor, etc for mortals from a zone.

  You may run with a mortal, but do not attack any enemies and do not heal
  them after every fight.

&+B[This policy may be changed at any time by the Gods]
