&+WLag Death Policy
&+b----------------
If you die from lag, there's not much we can do. There is the wimpy command
to help ensure that you aren't killed when the LagMonster strikes. And if
lag is that bad, just cut connection on the MUD -- it's alot better to lose
some items compared to losing half your points.
