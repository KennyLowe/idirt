&+WCloning Policy
&+b--------------
The cloning policy is fairly simple. Wizards, do not clone weapons, armor,
or food for mortals and let them run with them. If any Wizard is seen doing
so he will be punished as seen fit by the Gods.

This does not mean stop cloning. Please clone yourself a small zone and have
fun with it, but don't give mortals a better oppurtunity at running. If you
really want to make weapons, armor, etc for mortals to use, write a zone.

When cloning rooms, do not make them accesible to mortals from the world. You
are free to summon them and let them look around your zone, but that is the 
only way they should be able to get into your Wizard zone.
