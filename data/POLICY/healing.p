&+WHealing Policy
&+b--------------

Mortals: You may ask for a heal at any time, just remember that
         Wizards may not like you annoying them all the time with
         heal requests.

Wizards: You are free to heal whenever and whomever you choose. Just
         try to be fair about it and don't heal just one player all
         of the time. If this proves to be a problem, Wizards will
         only be allowed to healall and will lose the heal priviledge.

&+B[This policy may be changed at any time by the Gods]
