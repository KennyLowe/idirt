&+WHarassment Policy
&+b------------------
Harassment will not be tolerated on this MUD at all. If any user is harassing
you, first tell them to leave you alone. If they do not stop harassing you then 
report it to a power as soon as you can. If a power is harassing you, talk 
directly to Illusion or another God.

If there isn't a power or God online at the time, use the forget utility 
(HELP FORGET) and then mail a power or God about the user that is harassing you.

The person that was doing the harassing will be talked to by the power that he
was reported to and will be punished in a way that is deemed by the power.

&+B[This policy may be changed at any time by the Gods]
