&+WCut Connection Policy
&+b---------------------
If you are running, cutting connection is not suggested because Wizards+
are able to see the reason that you lost connection with the MUD. If the
connection loss was due to a real network error then ask a Wizard for help
and that Wizard should trans you back to where you lost connection.
