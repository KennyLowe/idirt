Limbo^
   You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of physical
matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the relative
darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.
   There is a "No Tipping" notice pinned to the darkness.

Hell^
  You are now in hell. The heat and searing flames slowly drive you mad
and you start to panic a little. There are clawmarks on the wall from
the last person that was brought here, and the pool of blood that you
step in doesn't help your nerves any. It seems that you upset the Gods
pretty well and you are now getting the punishment that you deserve.

   You stand in the Temple of Paradise, a huge stone structure whose walls are
decorated with ancient carvings and runes, some so old that even the priests no
longer know their meanings.
   A single set of steps lead south, descending the huge mound upon which the
temple is built and ending in the forests below. Above you is the realm for
mortals, a place to go to relax and talk with your friends.

is crowded with burly adventureres, shy novices, and the bustling of serving
wenches and bar-maids trying to take everyone's orders.
   The main door is to the south, and a side-door heads west into the frozen
wastes.  A number of urchins are gathered around the crackling fire to hear
tales and songs from the Bard.

is nowhere near as steep and a fair way up a single window has been cut,

   You are outside The Gate of Sorcerors.  Its mighty pillars tower up around
you, shielding you from the worst of the snow that is falling and from some of
the icy winds.  The ancient arched gateway between the pillars leads north into
a wide magically lit passage which disappears into the roots of the earth.
   You may enter the gate to the north, a lighted inn to the east, or trudge
south into the snows.

clouds of whiteness.
   The snows extend in all direction save east, where the crevasse bars the
route.  You could clamber down into the crevasse but would have great problems

   Stands have been hewn out of the mountain and intricately carved with an
animal motif.  Each of the 50 seats depicts a different creature, and all
appear calm and serene.

in  a  luxuriant  forest.  Gigantic trees of majestic proportions
surround you in all directions.  However, as far as your eyes can
see, there is nowhere dark under the trees.  Even where the trees
are largest the sunshine penetrates, subdued by  the  foliage  to
exquisite  greenish-golden  tints,  fills  the wide lower spaces.
Above you, golden shafts of light filtered through some break  in
the  foliage,  give a strange glory to everything they touch.  At
the center of the clearing is a great green  mound  covered  with
sward  of fragrant grass.  The mound is dotted with small golden,
white, and pale-green flowers shaped like stars, glimmering  like
a  mist amid the rich hue of the grass.  On the top of the mound,
upon a low pedstal stands a basin of silver,  wide  and  shallow,
filled with crystal clear water.  In the distance, like a tempest
of wind mixed with the shrilling music of  some  unknown  musical
instrument,  the  songs  of birds fill the air.  This place gives
you a strange sense of vibrant energy and contentment.

colors of some unseen rainbow. Surprisingly, the room is quite warm, upon
closer inspection, you notice a heating duct in one corner. Ah, the wonders

you smile. In front of the fireplace there is a soft bearskin rug
that looks quite inviting to curl up on and stare at the fire, or
to curl up with someone else and spend time together. Against the
north wall there is a luxurious bed that looks very inviting to
relax on. There is a dark blue comforter spread over the bed with
soft blue pillows on top of it next to the headboard.

hear a voice that is not old, young, male, or female. The voice speaks
softly, "Existence is an illusion that you make it to be.."

cracks and dips in the stonework allow it.  The steps turn from stone to wood
up above, and look very rickety.
   To the west a doorway leads out into the pulpit.

Fox Burrow^
   You are crawling around on your hands and knees in a cramped north-south fox
burrow.  The stench of fox permeates the burrow and gets even stronger towards
the south.  The air to the north is somewhat fresher.

Fox Den^
   You are wedged into a reeking fox den.  Strangely enough, the vixen has
built her den adjoining a huge natural cavern that extends deep into the earth,
much farther than your feeble flame can penetrate.  It looks like it might go
all the way to China!  You could jump in, but you would fall a long way....
There is a blinking construction sign here.

crypt.  Low moaning sounds echo from within the catacombs before you, sending
chills up your spine.
   An archway, its keystone carved in the shape of a human skull, leads south
into darkness, while cool air blows in from the relative safety of the church
above.

The Elven Forest^
   You stand at the entrance of what was once a grand elven forest.  Now, it
lies in ruins about you.  Blackened stumps abound and the trees which still
stand reek of decay.  This secluded vale has obviously been destroyed by some
great disaster.  You are overcome by a sense of foreboding! The evil which
ruined this forest may still be around!
   Although deeply disturbed by the destruction around you, you manage to look
about to determine your position.  To the North and East are the mountains
which shield this valley.  The area to the South of you also heads into
mountains, but a path makes passage possible.  An archway marks a tunnel
through the eastern mountains.

trees, is a small cottage.  To the North and West are the mountains which

of the walls, and by the potted plants which hang from the ceiling.  It is

did no protect the forest from whatever destroyed it...

   Your heart skips a beat as you enter this grove of trees.  Without a doubt,
this grove used to contain some of the strongest and most beautiful trees in
the entire elven forest.  Now, it looks as though a giant hand came down from
the heavens, and simply pushed the trees down, in a line from West to East.
The few Oaks which still stand have been warped into unhealthy shapes, which
nature itself could never produce.  Following the line of downed trees, you
realize that it leads to a freshly hewn pathway in the mountains to the West.

about, trees lie downed, as if hewn by some giant axe.  However, even the
twisted corpses of the trees seem unnatural.  Somehow, a single oak tree in
the center of the swath of destruction seems to have survived.  It lies just
to the east of you.  To the west, the line of destruction seems to continue.
Mercifully, mountains to the east protected any further realms from this
corruption.

Inside the Grand Oak^
   You gasp out in awe at the quiet beauty of this hidden hollow.  Looking
around, 'majesty' is the word which immediately comes to mind.  The entire
room draws your eyes upwards, like some ancient gothic cathedral. There, among
the arched, wooden roof, are numerous tiny flowers, hanging from the vines
which grow around you. Even in the dim light, the brilliant hues of the
flowers - red, violet, blue, green, and white - stand out. Indeed, they glow
with their own light, providing the majority of the illumination in this room
and sending incredible, multi-colored shadows around the room. As you stare at
them, something tugs at your memory. You have seen that pattern somewhere
before... It is the pattern of the stars in the night sky, but of a color and
brightness that the night sky can only hint at.
   As your eyes slowly refocus on the mundane plane, you notice a wooden
throne set near the middle of this room.  With a start, you realize that is
has been grown from the tree itself.  Once, the whole elven forest must have
been like this...

of destructions cuts into the heart of this realm.

Amid the destruction, you see a few points of life.  Just to the Northeast
of you stands a tall, healthy oak tree, while further to the North, you
actually think you see green.  The mountain trail you are on continues North

is covered by a wall of thorns.  On the other side, just to the West is a
sharp dropoff.  Past it, you can see the entire elven forest.  The corrupted

A broken tables lies off to one corner, with the remnants of a meal, ages old
on it, and several broken chairs litter the floor.  The room itself actually

   You stand at the entrance to what appears to be a vast system of caves.  A
cool breeze strikes you in the face as you peer ahead into the blackness, and
you sense strong evil emanating from the cavern.  To the west, you see the
blackened mouth of the cave, to the east, a downward sloping passage leads to
darkness.

   You are in a vast cavern.  The ceiling is lost in shadows, but you can make
out a ledge encircling the room.  Evenly spaced along the ledge are stone
gargoyles, which seem to be jeering at you.  In the wall far to the north, you
see the black mouth of a passage out, and the room seems to continue to the
east, where dim light can be made out.  To the south, an upward sloping passage
seems to ascend to the surface.

has apparently been constructed entirely underground!  The temple is made out
of some type of dark stone which glows with an unholy black light.  Without

ancient legends you have heard of a dark race of elves living below the
surface.  Surely, this is their realm!  Looking around you, this assumption
is upheld by the many dark shapes you see moving in the shadows.  You should
move through these realms quickly.  Surely the dark shapes would overwhelm
you by numbers if you stayed here too long.  Exits leave this cavern to the

and they are streched over a small, but very fastflowing river out of sight
to the southwest.  A very fastflowing river emerges out of the damwall a 
couple of yards west of you and disappears out of sight into southern parts of
the cavern.  There is no way of following the river southwards or crossing it.
Sparks jump now and then from lots of tiny cords which hang down from the 
three powerlines, thus enlightning the place in a strange blue and green light.
This place is surely in lack of maintainance, so you would better get
out of here.  It can be done by climbing a flight of stairs which is
cut out in the side of the wall.

insects must have been unused for decades.  There is an old desk here,
worn down both with age and with rough use from the maintainance-
personell which used this room as their base when doing work on the dam.

Steep Passage^
You are in a steep and narrow tunnel leading up.  This tunnel has
certainly not been used by to many guests, because the steeps are still
rough hewn and not worn down like other stairs in the area.  It has
probably been used only by people who once upon a time took care of the dam.
Down to the west is a large and sturdy steeldoor leading back into the cavern.

north and branches off into an eastgoing tunnel that is no less in

Carved into the rock of the two main tunnels are two big arrows; one
pointing to the north and the other to the east.  Under the first
arrow the word BANK is written and under the second one the words
MAIN GUE have been written.

Blocked-off Passage^
You are standing in the wide and highvaulted passage.  Unfortunatly the
passage has been block off by what to normal standards looks like a
major cave-in.  The cave-in consists of nothing but large and immovable
rocks.  From marks and scratches on the rocks you realise that there
have been other people here before you who have tried to make a
passage through the cave-in.  You might as weel give up the thought of
getting beyond this major rockfall.  A wiser decession is to reenter
to the west and try the north or south passage.

By the Bank^
You are standing at the corner of a building which looks like a bank.
It could as well be something else, but the word BANK was the first
word that entered your mind when getting near this place.
Let's say it is a bank.
The bank is actually not another cave, but it is built in a large cave,
and may therefore be called a building.
The main entrance to the bank is to the east, and north of here there
is a door which also leads into the bank.
A wide and high vaulted tunnel starts here and leads south.

The Main Entrance^
You stand in front of the main entrance of the bank which is dominated by
a huge and arched oakdoor set between mighty pillars carved out of
rock in one piece.  The door is barred with strong ironbars and it
will take you a lot of work to get through it.
It is possible to go east and west from the main entrance.

Blocked passage^
This tunnel east of the bank is stopped abruptly by a boulder which
fills the tunnel with rock from grinded stone-dust size up to the
size of rocks whick will never be moved by humans alone.
Even a mouse won't be able to crawl through this boulder.
Thus, the only exit for you is to the west.

Side Entrance^
This is the west side of the bank of Frobozz and it seems much more
promising than the main entrance.  That is due to a door of normal
size and construction which is situated right in front of you in a
corner of the building.  The bank is certainly in lack of windows, but
you have already figured out that the bank trusts the Great Under-
ground Empire's inhabitants because this side entrance will certainly
not be impossible to break down even for you.

The Bank of Frobozz^
You are in the main hall of the bank of Frobozz.  The roof is held up
by mighty stonepillars like those you saw outside the main door
which leads into this room.  The ceiling is made of dark wood, and
combined with the light colours which the walls are decorated with and
the fine gold inlay in the massive pillars the whole room resembles
something like a temple raised for a highheld god.
Right to the north is the tellers' room and that's where you may
withdraw sparemoney or let the bank take care of them.
In the south wall of this stunning room there is the main entrance to
the bank.  The door is barred with strong ironbars which makes the
bank look very safe.

abandoned just af if something terrible has happened.  They did not
even have time to clear the place from the waste and rubbish from their
meals.  The mess surely indicates that they didn't wait guests to pop in.
There is a door in the south wall and an entrance into the more important
parts of the bank.

The Tellers Room^
You have entered the tellers' room.  This is where the transactions of
money once in the past happened.  There are about a dozen of tidy and
rather impressing desks here which were used by the tellers when
doing business with their clients.  The desks are now covered with
dust.  To the south, through a high and arched opening you can look
into an impressive hall.  It is probably the main hall of the bank of
Frobozz.  Through a similar, but smaller opening to the north you see
a large and representable office.  There is also a doorway to the east
and to the west a doorway leads back into the luncheonroom.

on top of the southern wall are the letters "V A U L T".  But you can't seem
to find the vaultdoor.  Is it simply a walk-through-wall or is the vaultdoor
fitted so nicely into the wall that you can't find it ?
The room is lit by some kind of light which comes through a thickglassed 
window measuring 1 foot in square set into the northern wall.
The tellers' room lies to the west.

It is clear from the size both the room and its contents that this must
be the chairman's office.  The room measuring about 10 times 8 yards
contains nothing of excess, but the stuff that has been placed here
is of extraordinary quality and must surely have costed many a tellers
wages.  Right in front of you completly dominating the room is a large
mahogny desk which is one of the bigger you have seen.  Right behind it
placed up to the wall is a cupboard which in quality and splendor must
have been made by Chippendale himself.  More descretely in one corner
an inviting sitting-group almost begs you to take a seat.
To the south an opening leads into the tellers' room.

narrow tunnel you used to get here.
This chamber is nearly pitch dark, but a few sunbeams manage to get
through a crystal grating in the ceiling.  The grating is just
reachable but the size of it prevents you from climbing through it when opened.
Worth noticing are the extremely dark walls of this chamber.  It is as
if they are made of lightabsorbing material.

and you are glad it is not alive. The stairs lead upwards to the top of the
temple and down back to the clearing.

to pay more attention to a huge monolith laying before you. The monolith 
is four feet high and twelve feet wide. Its' face is smooth, but covered 
with dark red and brown spots all over it. This is probably a place where
the priests of this ancient city used to worship their god of Earth and the 
Universe later known as Quetzalcoatl by the Aztecs. The sight could easily 
turn a flesh-eating beast to a true vegetarian.

dive into the river, but as you see all the alligators you think it might

some god of these unknown people. On the north wall there stands a small 
bronze statue decorated with colorful stones. The statue stands firmly on 
the floor and it's almost impossible to move. The stone decorations, 
however, seem to be quite loose on the statue. Maybe you still can bring

room since there are several clay pots near the back wall.

Stairway to the Sun^
Up you go and you feel the endless strength of the sun making your climb 
to the top easier. You feel like a new-born child as you go up the last 
steps. Suddenly you notice that the sun has risen high up to the sky. 
The time seems to have lost its' significance to you.

Top of the Sun Pyramid^
You are standing on the top of the pyramid the sun shining brightly into your
face. Right before you there is a small altar probably made for sacrificing 
young virgins to the sun God.  You might feel a great relief that you are no 
longer a virgin, but just simply another, run of the mill, filthy foul-
mouthed wanderer.

You cautiously take some steps ahead and stand right before the moon. 
As you examine it more closely you suddenly start feeling a strange
desire for dairy products. My, this great heavenly body really is one 
big Emmental cheese. Maybe you could cut a piece or two of it.

You have discovered a moist dark passageway that disappears under the 
great sun pyramid. The air inside this narrow tunnel is stuffy and you
seriously consider whether you should go further or not. The tunnel 
continues to the east. To the south you see a narrow crack which makes 
you once again think about losing weight to make it easier to move 
between those rugged stone walls.

in the dim light coming from your torch. It looks like the rock around you

you feel quite uncomfortable and start feeling dizzy for some reason.

As you walk further the walls turn smooth and the floor is covered with
complicated and extremely beautiful ornaments. The ornaments are surrounding 
a long series of small pictures that seem to tell tales about this town's 
history. The story begins with a flourishing dynasty and an emperor who 
ruled the surrounding plains. To find out more you have to walk further 
to a large underground hall to the north. You notice that you still can 
turn back to the south.

abandoned, the astronomers found a new bright star in the sky. The star
was thought to be a sign of destruction coming to the town. You can see

brings light into this otherwise dim chamber. By studying the pictures on 
the floor, you find out that most of the slaves and servants were killed
when the upper class moved down underground. The ghosts of these poor people
still wander these lands of blood. To prevent the ghosts from entering
the underground town many guardians have been placed at the entrance.
The only exit is to the east.

The story tells that there was a disc of the mighty Sun God originally 
placed on top of the huge sun pyramid by the sun god himself. After the 
messages about the destruction were received, the priests had a holy 
stone and a feather of the sacred Quetzalbird, brought from a hermit 
living at the Tropic of Cancer to move this holy item. 
Passages lead north and south.

town. The emperor is believed to be the son of the sun god and you have

Signs of her wisdom and skill can still be found in the deserted town. 
There are calendars and large astronomical maps covering the walls.

The natives might like snakes and even worship them, but the snake living 
in this dim cellar doesn't much like you. Its' presence reminds you about
your mortality and makes you consider whether to leave at once or try to
slay that rattling thing before you. You suddenly notice that the floor
is covered with gold items and your natural greed makes you consider the
the matter even harder. The snake, however, is guarding these valuables so
you can't just take them and leave. It might already be too late to escape
back up.

reigned these, now so desolated, lands. The books have been written in some 
unknown language so you can't share the wisdom with those wizards who died
a long time ago. The owner of the books, however, seems not to have this
problem for the books look as if they have been read through thousands of
times during the preceding centuries.

the pursuit of their craft. The heat here is incredible, and you

Although the entire room is filled with wonders, your eyes are drawn
again and again to the mighty war banner of King Arthur, hanging on

ripples as a draft moves the cloth, and it seems to you that it is
almost alive, ready to spring down from it's perch to defend it's master.

his eyes you see only a cold calculating evil.

a rather peaceful room, for being a bedroom.

around this ancient stone-walled chamber you wonder just how old it is. 
A thick layer of green, slimy moss covers most of the walls. This chamber

Into the Depths^
   This is a narrow dark hole carved out of solid granite. It looks as if
it was hollowed out with crude tools. You traverse the depths by way of a
ladder-like structure etched into the rocks.  Below, small pebbles dislodge
from the movement of your feet against the crumbling, granite ladder disapears
deep into an abyss-like blackness, with no sound of hitting bottom.

   You are deep inside the earth, moving along a granite ladder covered with
slippery moss at some times, and missing rungs at others.

   You are now so far underground that sunlight has become nothing but a far-
fetched dream. The hot moist air bears heavily down upon you from above, the
stale air, and narrow walls seem to choke the very life out of you.
   Above, the shaft continues almost endlessly.  Below, sounds of activity
seem to be evident, but the dark may be playing tricks on your mind.

Bottom of the Ladder^
   This appears to be the end of an incredible descent into the depths.  You
are peering down into a large cavern below, which seems to be alive with
movement.  The entire cavern beneath is bathed in a dark orange glow, which
makes it difficult to distinguish living figures from shadows flitting in the
torchlight.
   It seems as if you could make your way down the sides of the cave, to the
bottom. To the west, a small crack, just wide enough to fit through, leads off
into the darkness. Above, the shaft leads back to a world that is but a quickly
fading memory in the somber blackness of the new realm you have discovered.

Certain Death^
   You enter a dim cave, and reach forward to crawl into the cavern, only to
find you are grasping thin air while plummeting to your death in a black pit
at breakneck speed. You lose consciousness, and never even feel your bones
shatter into thousands of pieces as your life finds its destiny at the hands
of cold, twisted rocks.

   You stand in the center of a large cavern, which appears to have formed
naturally from the movement of an underwater stream, flowing from a waterfall
halfway up the side of the cavern. Torches line the walls, and cast an eerie
orange glow over the entire cave. The roof is smoked black from the numerous
torches scorching its surface.
   The underground stream disapears into a small cave to the west. To the
south, a small crack wide enough to squeeze through leads into the blackness.
To the east, cool air seems to pour through a large opening leading to another
cave.

and forms stalagmites, which makes passage through the cavern difficult.
   A strange white light shines through the stalactites and stalagmites to
give the ghostly appearance of passing through the mouth of a tremendous
dragon.

reflected from the water across to the walls and cave's ceiling.
   To the west is a small cave preceeded by a shore of rocks and moist clay.
To the south, water from the lake continues its underground journey in a small
stream, and to the east, water empties into the lake from a small cave.

of shifting gateway into the unknown. The porthole is like a distorted mirror,
fluctuating at every instant in size and shape, and it casts strange white
waves of light across the cavern as it changes in shape.

below. You think you might just be able to scramble down the rocks to the
side of the waterfall, but it looks very treacherous. The stream flows in from

through your very soul like fire. The walls here are as black as the darkest
coal, and the sand on the floor has been melted into a sheet of solid glass.
It looks as if a great flame has passed through this room. A thunderous
rumble which seems almost creaturelike, eminates from a cavern to the south.
To the north lies the other side of this huge cavern. To the east is a small,

mountain on the horizon. To the west, a deep blue ocean beats endlessly upon

retreats behind the dark mantains, to no more shine its face upon the
horrifying sight, for yet another starless night.

fog twisting and turning as if it were alive.

utterly black as any ray of the sun has been choked out of existence
by the dark haze. A small and precarious path leads up the side of the mountain
and a path continues back to the west of a valley bathed in shadows.

Entrance Hall^
    As you step into the entrance hall, the stone dragons bellow in anger

    and chase after you. You run ahead of them, terror in your heart. One

    spreads its stone wings and flies ahead of you. You are trapped between

    the two of them. The last sight you see is them approaching you.

Sacred Clearing^
    The floor of the clearing is lined with pure white sand, and the
air throbs with immense stored magical energy. Time seems to pass in a
blur: Flowers sprout beneath your feet and die off again in seconds.
You feel a strange sensation on your legs and when you look down there
is a large ivy twining itself around your calfs. Paths lead off in all
directions. To the south, east, and west thin trails lead through lush
green forest, and to the north lies a huge forest of living crystal.

Crystal Trail^
    Huge crystaline trees overhang the trail and delicate crystal flowers
grow on the edge. You are afraid to touch any of them for fear that they
will shatter. Heavy wind blows through the tops of the trees, and to the
east there is an ominous groaning and cracking noise.

Crystal Trees^
    As you pass beneath the magestic crystal trees, a gust of wind blows

    through the top branches. There is a tremendous crack, and as you gaze

    up in horror a huge crystal branch crashes through the thinner boughs.

    You run as fast as possible, and throw yourself to the ground. The

    huge branch misses you, but when it strikes the ground it shatters

    into thousands of needle sharp shards. Almost is slow motion, several

    pieces fly at you, and the last thing you see is the sunlight glinting

    through them in beautiful rainbow patterns.

Dead End^
    Huge boughs from the crystalline trees have broken off and fallen to
the ground here, creating an impassable blockage of needle sharp crystal
shards. The only way out is to return to the narrow path to the east.

Crystal Path^
    A small path leads through the heart of this forest of living crystal.
A light breeze whistles through the boughs overhead, and as the branches
rub together a beautiful melody floats through the air. The path continues
to the north and south, but it appears to dead end to the west.

Crystal Border^
    Here the magical crystaline forest merges with normal forest, the green
crystal merging in a shifting kaleidascope. The crystal forest streches
away to the north, and a thin path winds through it. The path continues to
the east.

Forest Edge^
    The magical crystaline forest here merges with normal forest, the green
refracted through the crystal boughs into a shimmering rainbow of color.
The crystal forest coninues to the west and north, but the northern forest
if much too thick to try to forge through. To the south the natural green
forest continues.

Green Forest^
    Healthy green forest streches as far as the eye can see. Far to the north
you hear a faint musical song. The forest to the west is filled with brambles
and there is no way to get through. A thin trail that must have been made by
animals leads to the south, and the forest continues unabated to the north.

oak forest. The magestic trees strech hundreds of feet above your head,
their leaves swaying gently in the wind. To the south the trees thin out
and you hear the muted crackle of pent-up magical energy.

Thick Forest^
    It is hard to tell which direction is which in this thick forest. The
only way you can tell directions is that there is a huge clearing filled
with immense magical energy to the north. The forest continues to the east,
but all other directions are blocked by brambles and thorns.

Forest^

    The grass here is trimmed short, and to the north the deep forest
streches towards the horizon. To the south is an immense wooden gate that
stand open, showing what appears to be a perfectly normal rocky path. The
gate itself crackles with heavy stored magical energy that occaisionally
discharges into the sky in huge reverse lightning bolts.

Tiny Hut^
    You stand within a tiny hut that appears to be woven of living branches
and vines, probably by an elf for temporary shelter. The roof of the hut
stands open to the weather, the magic that allowed air to pass through but
not rain having since worn off. The only exit from the hut is back to the
north.

Temple^
    This temple is dedicated to the elemental gods. Each wall is painted with
intricate and beautiful murals, each of a different elemental deity. The
north wall is painted with a figure surrounded with lightning bolts, the
west wall is painted with a figure made completly of water stands up from
the sea, and on the east wall there is a figure that is made of living
vines, rocks, and other matter standing high above a forest. The south wall

there is nothing but beautifully manicured gardens.

    The small garden is filled by beautifully carved statues of the elemental
gods: Naidrk the water god, Thandrain the earth god, and Klendoth the thunder
god. In between the statues are immense guardian dragon statues, their
immense size almost rivaling that of the statues. Clearly among these people
dragons are held almost at the level of the elemental gods.

fish glitter iridescently in the sunlight, occaisionally leaping out of the
water to snatch a bug that has strayed too close to the surface. The

for hours.

fountain.

  You have stepped into the mortal realms, a place for mortals to come to
just to get away from the harsh world. It is very peaceful here and you
decide that you might as well take a little break from all the adventuring
that you have been doing. There are exits in all directions, or you can go
to the Temple of Paradise to the south and continue on your quests.

types of soda is built into the north wall. Set into the west wall is a big
screen TV with a Sony Playstation resting on the floor in front of it. Next
to the TV is a stereo system playing dance mix music. Set into the east wall
is a wetbar with a glowing neon sign that says 'Always Open'. So please, pour
yourself a drink, sit back and relax.
