Limbo^
   You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of physical
matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the relative
darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.
   There is a "No Tipping" notice pinned to the darkness.

Hell^
  You are now in hell. The heat and searing flames slowly drive you mad
and you start to panic a little. There are clawmarks on the wall from
the last person that was brought here, and the pool of blood that you
step in doesn't help your nerves any. It seems that you upset the Gods
pretty well and you are now getting the punishment that you deserve.

Runners Holding Area^
  It seems that the Gods are not allowing players to explore the MUD at this
time. You may wait here for them to finish what they are doing or you may 
leave and return again later. The Gods apologize for this inconvience.

The Temple Of Paradise^
   You stand in the Temple of Paradise, a huge stone structure whose walls are
decorated with ancient carvings and runes, some so old that even the priests no
longer know their meanings.
   A single set of steps lead south, descending the huge mound upon which the
temple is built and ending in the forests below. Above you is the realm for
mortals, a place to go to relax and talk with your friends.

   You are in the village's small wooden church.  A gentle breeze blows into
the church disturbing the dust which dances in the sunbeams that shine faintly
through the windows. Above you is the realm for mortals, a place to go to 
relax and talk with your friends. A doorway leads south.

Warm Haven^
   After hours of trudging through the snow you come upon a tiny inn.  A sign
above the door says "Warm Haven -- Abandon Cold, All Ye Who Enter."  The room
is crowded with burly adventureres, shy novices, and the bustling of serving
wenches and bar-maids trying to take everyone's orders.
   The main door is to the south, and a side-door heads west into the frozen
wastes.  A number of urchins are gathered around the crackling fire to hear
tales and songs from the Bard.
