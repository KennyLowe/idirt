lflags {Outdoors}
The Village Green^
   You are standing on a square of grass in the center of the village.  A road
leads east into the rest of the village.
   To the north is a small church, and a path leads west into the trees.
^
Track e:Road1 w:Green n:hick1@hick;
lflags {Outdoors}
Village Track^
   You are following a path which leads east through the village towards the
sea.  To the west a few buildings are clustered around the village green, while
to the east the village becomes a collection of small houses and narrow
streets.  A small path leads to the north.
^
Road1 n:Yard e:Road2 s:Alley w:Track;
lflags {Outdoors}
Village Road^
   You are following a narrow dirt road which leads east into the village.  To
the north a track leads into a small yard of some sort, to the south it leads
down a narrow walled alley to the village well.
^
Yard s:Road1;
lflags {Outdoors}
Yard^
   You are in a small walled dirt yard in the village.  Various large pieces of
rotten fishing netting lie all around you, and the yard stinks with the smell
of rotting fish, a scent which seems to draw thousands of sea birds flapping
around you.
^
Alley n:Road1 d:Well2 ;
lflags {Outdoors}
Narrow Alley^
   You are standing in a narrow alleyway which deadends to the south.  The
alley is dark and dismal and is simply a walled passage down to a small well
which appears to serve the village itself.
^
Road2 e:Shore s:Inn_Yard w:Road1 n:Road3;
lflags {Outdoors}
Village Road^
   You are following the narrow main street of the village which leads east
and west and branches off to the north.  To the south, the worn sign of 
the Old Seadog Inn flaps quietly in the wind.
^
Inn_Yard n:Road2 e:Seadog ;
lflags {Outdoors}
Inn Yard^
   You are standing in the yard of the Old Seadog Inn.  The inn itself stands
to the east, a battered structure half timbered and sagging, with that pleasant
atmosphere of ages.  To the north a narrow gateway leads back onto the road.
^
Seadog e:Behind w:Inn_Yard;
lflags {}
The Old Seadog^
   You are standing in the 'Old Seadog' inn.  The inn radiates age and charm,
with its oak beam roof, and many seafaring momentos secured firmly around the
walls.  Even the bar is a single thick oak slab, worn and chipped with years of
service to rowdy sailors.
   The door out is west.
^
Behind e:Barman w:Seadog d:Steps ;
lflags {}
Behind The Bar^
   You are standing behind the bar of the 'Old Seadog'.  The bar surface is
worn and pitted from years and years of heavy use.  Names are carved into its
surface, 'Black Sea Pete', 'Grey Hook', 'Moog The Kipper', no doubt some of the
pirates who long ago made this their haunt.
   A narrow stairway leads down, and a small room can be seen through a low
doorway to the east.
^
Barman w:Behind;
lflags {}
Barman's Room^
   You are crouched in the barman's small, and very personalized room.  The
walls have a large collection of battered naval memorabilia fastened securely
to them.  Indeed, even the lone window is a porthole, giving the room that
distinctive sea-cabin look.  A single low doorway leads west into the inn
proper.
^
Steps u:Behind d:Cellar ;
lflags {}
Cellar Steps^
   You are standing on the narrow, precarious steps which lead down into the
cellars of the inn.  A pale shaft of light shines down from the top of the
steps, revealing the cellars below.
^
Shore e:Jetty w:Road2 ;
lflags {Outdoors}
Village Shore^
   You stand on the sea shore, to the east of the village. A narrow jetty leads
east out into the waves.  The road also leads westwards back into the center of
the village.
^
Jetty e:2@sea w:Shore ;
lflags {Outdoors}
The Jetty^
   You stand on the jetty, looking east across the waves.  A path leads west
along the jetty back to the village.

Well1 ;
lflags {Death}
Down The Well^
   You slip and lose your grip, then plunge helplessly into the waters below...
^
Well2 e:Tunnel u:Alley d:Well1;
lflags {}
Down The Well^
   You are hanging part of the way down the village well, looking upwards
towards the light above.  The well descends further but it gets very slippery.
A narrow passage leads east into absolute darkness.
^
Tunnel e:Dirt w:Well2 ;
lflags {Dark}
Narrow Tunnel^
   You are squeezing down a narrow dirt tunnel, quite crudely dug, and
supported with old ships timbers.  The tunnel leads westwards towards a faint
light, or descends steeply to the east.
^
Dirt n:Slanted e:Chamber w:Tunnel;
lflags {Dark}
Dirt Tunnel^
   You are clambering along a low dirt tunnel which leads east and west.
A wider tunnel joins from the north.
^
Chamber s:Passage w:Dirt;
lflags {Dark}
Dim Chamber^
   You are standing in a dim, and secret chamber deep underground.  Narrow
rough passages lead west and south.
^
Passage n:Chamber u:^bot_boards;
lflags {Dark}
Passage End^
   The passage here ends with a blank stone wall, possibly foundations to a
building.  Above you is a set of floorboards.
^
Cellar u:Steps d:^top_boards;
lflags {Dark}
Cellars^
   You are stooped down low, in the cellars of the 'Old Seadog'.  The room is
dark and shadowy lit only by a pale light from high above at the top of the
steps.  The room stinks of cheap ale and rotting wood.
^
Slanted n:Narrow s:Dirt;
lflags {Dark}
Slanted Tunnel^
   You are clambering down a fairly wide earthen passage which descends from a
junction of passages towards a turning of some sort.  The dirt floor is hard,
as if heavy objects have passed this way many times.
^
Narrow e:Cave s:Slanted;
lflags {Dark}
Narrow Tunnel^
   You are clambering down a narrow tunnel which slopes downwards and east
turning from the south.  From the east you can smell the sea and hear the sound
of waves against the shore...
^
Cave e:Cove w:Narrow;
lflags {}
Sea Cave^
   You are standing in a low, reasonably dry sea cave.  The cave echoes the
gentle pounding of the waves on the sandy beach to the east.  A single narrow
passage leads west into darkness.
^
Cove e:7@sea  w:Cave ;
lflags {}
Secret Cove^
   You are standing in a secret cove surrounded by high black crags.  A narrow
cavemouth leads west into darkness. The rocks and pounding surf along the shore
here makes launching boats well nigh impossible.
^
Road3 s:Road2 e:house1@playhouse;
lflags { }
Village Road^
   You are following a narrow dirt road which leads south. To the east it 
leads into a house that looks like a day care center.
