wall.  The stairs continue up and down from here.

   The stairs end abruptly in a small room hewn from the living rock. The walls
are rough, giving this room that "about to be worked on" feel.  At the moment,
however, your only exit is back up the stairs.
There is a blinking construction sign here.

are all decorated with dwarvish battle scenes and, high up, dwarven momentos of
great age are hung, golden banners, shining axes, helms, and many other items
of war and craft.

down into the cellars, and a wide sweeping staircase leads up to a high balcony
overlooking the hall.

room that few are privileged to see.  A single door leads east.
   There is a charred shape on the wall, somewhat resembling an ex neccy Moog

The cavemouth is to the north but is twisted enough that you cannot see out,
and it also provides good shelter against the wind.  To the south a narrow and
low arched opening leads into another cave.
   The cave is clean and evidently well used by its occupant although who he
is, its hard to tell.

   You are in a small clean cave, which appears to serve as a storeroom for the
