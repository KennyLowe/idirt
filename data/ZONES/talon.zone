Entrance^
   A large, moss covered cliff face is straight ahead of you. High above,
ancient trees line the top of the cliff, and seem to ominously look down upon
the travellers of this land. On a windless day as today, the branches seem to
echo a whisper of warning and doom.
   There seems to be an entranceway carved out of the cliff face to the north,
and the nearby trampled path from whence you came lies to the south.

Shadowy Cave^
   This is a small, damp, musty smelling cave. There are shadows lining two of
the walls and a broken structure resembling a table lying in one corner of
the room. To the east lies another room, too dark to discern its purpose. To
the north lies a room resembling a storage area, and to the south lies the
safety of a land bathed in fresh air and sunlight.

Study^
   You enter a small dark study filled with various articles of clothes. A
large antique bookcase lies on the northern wall.
   The room seems to be in a state of disarray, as books and papers seem to be
thrown out of place, as if someone was searching for something.

Into the Depths^
   This is a narrow dark hole carved out of solid granite. It looks as if
it was hollowed out with crude tools. You traverse the depths by way of a
ladder-like structure etched into the rocks.  Below, small pebbles dislodge
from the movement of your feet against the crumbling, granite ladder disapears
deep into an abyss-like blackness, with no sound of hitting bottom.
^

Narrow Shaft^
   You are deep inside the earth, moving along a granite ladder covered with
slippery moss at some times, and missing rungs at others.

Below, the blackness stretches on, too far to measure.

Narrow Shaft^
   You are now so far underground that sunlight has become nothing but a far-
fetched dream. The hot moist air bears heavily down upon you from above, the
stale air, and narrow walls seem to choke the very life out of you.
   Above, the shaft continues almost endlessly.  Below, sounds of activity
seem to be evident, but the dark may be playing tricks on your mind.

Bottom of the Ladder^
   This appears to be the end of an incredible descent into the depths.  You
are peering down into a large cavern below, which seems to be alive with
movement.  The entire cavern beneath is bathed in a dark orange glow, which
makes it difficult to distinguish living figures from shadows flitting in the
torchlight.
   It seems as if you could make your way down the sides of the cave, to the
bottom. To the west, a small crack, just wide enough to fit through, leads off
into the darkness. Above, the shaft leads back to a world that is but a quickly
fading memory in the somber blackness of the new realm you have discovered.

Certain Death^
   You enter a dim cave, and reach forward to crawl into the cavern, only to
find you are grasping thin air while plummeting to your death in a black pit
at breakneck speed. You lose consciousness, and never even feel your bones
shatter into thousands of pieces as your life finds its destiny at the hands
of cold, twisted rocks.

Lit Cavern^
   You stand in the center of a large cavern, which appears to have formed
naturally from the movement of an underwater stream, flowing from a waterfall
halfway up the side of the cavern. Torches line the walls, and cast an eerie
orange glow over the entire cave. The roof is smoked black from the numerous
torches scorching its surface.
   The underground stream disapears into a small cave to the west. To the
south, a small crack wide enough to squeeze through leads into the blackness.
To the east, cool air seems to pour through a large opening leading to another
cave.

Through the Teeth^
   You enter a long cave, with a low ceiling and walls etched with strange
markings. Water drips slowly to the floor from stalactites in the ceiling,
and forms stalagmites, which makes passage through the cavern difficult.
   A strange white light shines through the stalactites and stalagmites to
give the ghostly appearance of passing through the mouth of a tremendous
dragon.

Underground Stream^
   You are waist deep in ice cold water which rushes quietly past you to the
west into the blackness. The sharp rocks underneath the water cut and grab
at your feet to make passage treacherous.
   On a dry ledge to the north, a small hole, barely passable, leads into
the unknown.
^
talon13 e:talon12 s:talon14 w:talon15;
lflags { }
Underground Lake^
   The cavern opens up into a tremendous underground lake, and although some
small ripples are caused by the incoming stream, it is as calm, and as clear
as finely polished glass. The entire cave glows from waves of light
emanating from an exit to the far southern side of the lake, which are
reflected from the water across to the walls and cave's ceiling.
   To the west is a small cave preceeded by a shore of rocks and moist clay.
To the south, water from the lake continues its underground journey in a small
stream, and to the east, water empties into the lake from a small cave.

Underground Stream^
   The stream flows here from the north and continues in a cavern to the east.
The rocks here are very slippery, and you feel as if at any moment you could
lose your footing, slip, and be carried into the depths by the current rushing
around you. There is a strange light shining through the water which appears
to get brighter as the stream continutes to the east.

Cavern into the Unknown^
   You stand in a wide cavern with a soft sandy floor. To the western side of
the cavern, a strange dim white light pours from what appears to be some kind
of shifting gateway into the unknown. The porthole is like a distorted mirror,
fluctuating at every instant in size and shape, and it casts strange white
waves of light across the cavern as it changes in shape.
   To the east lies the underground lake.
^
talon16 w:talon14 d:talon53;

Waterfall^
   The stream here becomes extremely fast, and disappears over a waterfall
which plummets down, at least one hundred feet to the bottom. There is a light
which seems to have gotten even brighter here than to the west, and it
continues to increase in intensity as you look down the waterfall to the pool
below. You think you might just be able to scramble down the rocks to the
side of the waterfall, but it looks very treacherous. The stream flows in from
a cavern to the west.

Southern End of Cavern^
   You enter the southern end of a tremendous cavern which spans out before
you. The air here is turbulent, and filled with an excited energy which runs
through your very soul like fire. The walls here are as black as the darkest
coal, and the sand on the floor has been melted into a sheet of solid glass.
It looks as if a great flame has passed through this room. A thunderous
rumble which seems almost creaturelike, eminates from a cavern to the south.
To the north lies the other side of this huge cavern. To the east is a small,
ever-fluctuating porthole promising passage back to the realm you had come to
know as reality, 'til now.

Northern End of Cavern^
   You enter the northern end of a monstrous cavern. The walls here are as
scorched as those in the southern end of the cavern, but they seem to glow with
a dark, ruby-red fire. Although the walls are searing to the touch, the air is
as cool and fresh as an October morning.
   To the west, light and a brisk wind pours through a large opening. Back
to the south, the cave stretches out before you.

The Chasm^
   You stand on a narrow natural bridge crossing a giant chasm. A bright yellow
sun shines down upon you, and clears your darkness-ridden mind. A cool wind
blows across your skin, reminding you of what it is to be alive, for now.
Below, the chasm continues downwards, and disappears into a mist of swirling
clouds.
   To the west, the bridge leads to a small ledge carved into the side of a
mountain. To the east, a cave leads back into the large cavern.

Small Ledge^
   You stand on a small ledge overlooking a drop-off into the immeasurable

lies a small, dark cave. To the side of the ledge a very treacherous-looking
trail leads down the cliff.

Small Cavern^
   This is a smaller cavern which has no apparent exit, save the opening you
entered from. The walls in this cave seem to be covered with strange markings.
The markings appear to show a sort of battle which takes place between a
warrior and a terrifying-looking black dragon.
   In one drawing, the warrior is slaughtered by the dragon, and in another,
the warrior defeats the dragon while wearing an odd-looking shield. For some
reason, the warrior seems strangely familiar.

At the Edge of Oblivion^

Atop the Mountain^
   You stand at the peak of the tallest mountain in the land. To the east, a
large canyon separates two tremendous mountain ranges. Even further to the
east, the landscape seems to fade into a shade of black, darker than onyx.
You can barely make out the shape of a large dark castle atop a huge black
mountain on the horizon. To the west, a deep blue ocean beats endlessly upon
the cliffs of a mountain range lining its shores. As you look, you feel as if
one small jump could take you to the ends of the earth from here. To the north,
a strangely blank cliffside juts up above you.

   You enter a small room which appears to end to the east in a mirror-like
porthole. White light travels across the porthole in the area, like lightning
on a dark, stormy summer's sky. Beyond the brilliant white light on the surface
of the gateway, a strange evil darkness seems to emanate. It is hard to
distinguish if it is a physical, or spiritual darkness which you seem to sense.
Back to the west lies the safety of the known world.

The Mist^
   You step into a thick shroud of a choking, white fog. Your senses are
confused as you wander aimlessly through the swirling mist. All of reality
becomes a forgotten blur, as whispers seem to echo around ou from all sides,
and shadows seem to lunge toward you, only to melt back into the depths of the

Dead Landscape^
   You stand upon a small foothill looking upon a charred, black valley. The
entire valley looks as if a tremendous fire decended from the sky and
consumed all life in its path. Blackened stumps lie here and there, where
mighty trees once stood. A blood red haze encompasses the sky as the sun
retreats behind the dark mantains, to no more shine its face upon the
horrifying sight, for yet another starless night.
   To the east lies passage down into the valley. To the west lies a blanket of
fog twisting and turning as if it were alive.

more black and evil as you travel to the east. All around you, shadows seem to
dance around the edges of the fading red light, as if anticipating the
overcoming darkness. To the west, a dark foothill looms before you, as if
suspended in the darkness. To the east, you can make out a large black castle
built on the side of a towering mountain peak.

lies near the top of the peak, and every so often a stream of fire emanates
from the tallest of the towers of the castle. The sky here is now almost
utterly black as any ray of the sun has been choked out of existence
by the dark haze. A small and precarious path leads up the side of the mountain
and a path continues back to the west of a valley bathed in shadows.

   You stand at the gates of a large, black castle. You are in the midst of
the suffocating, black haze which rains down upon this land. An air of impeding
evil weighs down heavily upon your soul as you scan the length of this
monstrous castle. Down below, the landscape stretches out before you, and for a
moment, light seemed to reflect from a tall mountain in the distance, but then
a cloud of smog drifts before your eyes.

responsible for the demise of this land.

this room, and seem to jeer down in evil delight at your curiosity which may
just cause your demise. Above an archway to the east, the deep black letters
TALON are carved into stone.
