Northern End of the House^
You are standing in an open field north of a white house, with a boarded front 
door.  The house is surrounded with dense forest to the north and the east, 
and west of the house a deep canyon splits the country from north to south.
There's a path which runs north into the forest and two smaller paths which
runs from the front door and around the house east and west.

Western End of the House^
You are standing west of the small white house, which has a small window set
into the wall.  The view westwards is magnificent, showing a deep canyon
cutting through the landscape from the north and southwards.  On the other
side of the canyon you can see vast fields stretching several miles into the
land before ending where a big mountainrange cuts out through the surface of
the earth.  This view certainly makes the white house look small and insign-
ificant, which at its western wall offers nothing but a small window.
There is a tiny little path going around the house to the north and south here.

The Kitchen^
You are in a tiny kitchen.  The strong smell of food indicates that something
edible has been prepared here recently.  A few empty shelves line the eastern
wall and under them is a bench.  The bench bears the marks of a very sharp
knife being used for the preparation of food.  A bricked chimney is standing
at the south wall.
A narrow stair ascends into darkness, while a doorway leads south into
a livingroom.  A small window is set into the western wall.

This is the livingroom of the small white house, and in earlier days it must

furniture and a large oriental rug are badly ravaged.  
There is a single exit north into the kitchen.

You are standing on a ledge a couple of feet above a pool filled with water
from the waterfall above you.  The noise of the waterfall hitting the pool is
quite immense, but you still feel relaxed by being here.  A few salmon are
swimming around in the clear water snapping a fly now and then. A rainbow
spans the pool in the spray of the waterfall. 
The water flows southwards forming a river which through thousands of years
has dug out a big canyon cutting through the land.  To the west, across the
canyon, you can see large fields and further beyond, a mountainrange.
A though, but managable climb will take you up into the mountain above, while
a southgoing track leads into a vast forest.

Cellar^
You are in a cellar right under the livingroom.  The air here is a bit damp,
and together with an odd human-like smell drifting in from the south this
place is not where you would like to stay for the night.
A faint light shines in from the north while a passage leads south into
darkness and what you sense is danger.  You may of course also retreat
back up into the livingroom.

This part of the cellar is not that damp due to a faint, but fresh

Lookout-Point^
You are standing on a wide ledge overlooking a huge cavern.  The river
in the canyon west of the house comes into the cavern through a large
opening to the north, filling it with water.  Bright light shines
through the opening of the cavern and, reflected by the water, it
illuminates the cavern with dim light.
The water flows slowly southwards into a huge reservoir in the deeper
parts of the cave.
An eastward path leads back to where you came from.

You are in a wide and smooth tunnel with an entrance just north of you
which leads into a room which looks like a workshop.

it is abruptly cut off by a brick wall.
There is an arched opening in the brick wall, through which you can see
racks and shelves.

This is probably the place where the once mighty and powerfull Wizard

You have entered a rather large storeroom which is filled with racks

You are about 20 steps from the bottom of the stairs.  You notice the small
growth of slippery moss and lichen covering both steps and walls.  You can
hear small splashing noises comming up from down below.

Bottom of the Stairs^
You are standing by the east wall of an enormous cavern.  This cavern
is in fact a huge reservoir of water, and stretching out before you to
the west is an artificial damwall.
Up to the north is a steep stairway, and one step up from the ground
right east of you is a large and heavy steeldoor, which is corroded stuck in
an open position.  The east end of the damwall is south.

East End of Dam^
You are standing on the eastern part of a damwall.
The damwall, being about 30 meters wide continues westwards to the other
end of the cavern. Through a door to the east there's a little office
obviously used by maintainance personell in the times when there where
more traffic here than at present.  There's also a flight of steps leading
down on the south side of the damwall.  It disappears into the deep and
dark dry area of the cavern which is kept dry by the damwall.
To the north you can make out the beginning of a staircase leading up.

Halfway Down the Stairs^
You are halfway down a flight of stairs which leads up into a highvaulted
cavern which is dimly lit.  Down below you, in the darkness, is a outlet 
of some powerlines.

lflags {Dark}
The Outlet^
You are down at the base of the damwall which stretches up houndreds of feet 
above you.  Right above you, out of the wall, three thick powerlines emerge
and they are streched over a small, but very fastflowing river out of sight
to the southwest.  A very fastflowing river emerges out of the damwall a 
couple of yards west of you and disappears out of sight into southern parts of
the cavern.  There is no way of following the river southwards or crossing it.
Sparks jump now and then from lots of tiny cords which hang down from the 
three powerlines, thus enlightning the place in a strange blue and green light.
This place is surely in lack of maintainance, so you would better get
out of here.  It can be done by climbing a flight of stairs which is
cut out in the side of the wall.

The Dam^
Standing here on the middle of this huge damwall makes you feel small
compard to your surroundings.  Way down below you on the south side of
the damwall you hear the sound of fastflowing water and to the north
the huge cavern stretches out for houndreds of yards.  The damwall
continues to the east and west.

Dam Office^
You are in the damoffice, which according to piles of dust and dead
insects must have been unused for decades.  There is an old desk here,
worn down both with age and with rough use from the maintainance-
personell which used this room as their base when doing work on the dam.

Steep Passage^
You are in a steep and narrow tunnel leading up.  This tunnel has
certainly not been used by to many guests, because the steeps are still
rough hewn and not worn down like other stairs in the area.  It has
probably been used only by people who once upon a time took care of the dam.
Down to the west is a large and sturdy steeldoor leading back into the cavern.

You are in a wide and highvaulted passageway which comes in from the
north and branches off into an eastgoing tunnel that is no less in

Carved into the rock of the two main tunnels are two big arrows; one
pointing to the north and the other to the east.  Under the first
arrow the word BANK is written and under the second one the words
MAIN GUE have been written.

Blocked-off Passage^
You are standing in the wide and highvaulted passage.  Unfortunatly the
passage has been block off by what to normal standards looks like a
major cave-in.  The cave-in consists of nothing but large and immovable
rocks.  From marks and scratches on the rocks you realise that there
have been other people here before you who have tried to make a
passage through the cave-in.  You might as weel give up the thought of
getting beyond this major rockfall.  A wiser decession is to reenter
to the west and try the north or south passage.

By the Bank^
You are standing at the corner of a building which looks like a bank.
It could as well be something else, but the word BANK was the first
word that entered your mind when getting near this place.
Let's say it is a bank.
The bank is actually not another cave, but it is built in a large cave,
and may therefore be called a building.
The main entrance to the bank is to the east, and north of here there
is a door which also leads into the bank.
A wide and high vaulted tunnel starts here and leads south.
^

The Main Entrance^
You stand in front of the main entrance of the bank which is dominated by
a huge and arched oakdoor set between mighty pillars carved out of
rock in one piece.  The door is barred with strong ironbars and it
will take you a lot of work to get through it.
It is possible to go east and west from the main entrance.

Blocked passage^
This tunnel east of the bank is stopped abruptly by a boulder which
fills the tunnel with rock from grinded stone-dust size up to the
size of rocks whick will never be moved by humans alone.
Even a mouse won't be able to crawl through this boulder.
Thus, the only exit for you is to the west.

Side Entrance^
This is the west side of the bank of Frobozz and it seems much more
promising than the main entrance.  That is due to a door of normal
size and construction which is situated right in front of you in a
corner of the building.  The bank is certainly in lack of windows, but
you have already figured out that the bank trusts the Great Under-
ground Empire's inhabitants because this side entrance will certainly
not be impossible to break down even for you.

The Bank of Frobozz^
You are in the main hall of the bank of Frobozz.  The roof is held up
by mighty stonepillars like those you saw outside the main door
which leads into this room.  The ceiling is made of dark wood, and
combined with the light colours which the walls are decorated with and
the fine gold inlay in the massive pillars the whole room resembles
something like a temple raised for a highheld god.
Right to the north is the tellers' room and that's where you may
withdraw sparemoney or let the bank take care of them.
In the south wall of this stunning room there is the main entrance to
the bank.  The door is barred with strong ironbars which makes the
bank look very safe.

strongest concrete available and they are probably several feet thick.

Luncheon Room^
You have just entered the bank-personells luncheon room.  The room is
abandoned just af if something terrible has happened.  They did not
even have time to clear the place from the waste and rubbish from their
meals.  The mess surely indicates that they didn't wait guests to pop in.
There is a door in the south wall and an entrance into the more important
parts of the bank.

The Tellers Room^
You have entered the tellers' room.  This is where the transactions of
money once in the past happened.  There are about a dozen of tidy and
rather impressing desks here which were used by the tellers when
doing business with their clients.  The desks are now covered with
dust.  To the south, through a high and arched opening you can look
into an impressive hall.  It is probably the main hall of the bank of
Frobozz.  Through a similar, but smaller opening to the north you see
a large and representable office.  There is also a doorway to the east
and to the west a doorway leads back into the luncheonroom.

Outside the Vault^
You are in what must be the entrance to the vault of the bank because written
on top of the southern wall are the letters "V A U L T".  But you can't seem
to find the vaultdoor.  Is it simply a walk-through-wall or is the vaultdoor
fitted so nicely into the wall that you can't find it ?
The room is lit by some kind of light which comes through a thickglassed 
window measuring 1 foot in square set into the northern wall.
The tellers' room lies to the west.

Chairmans Office^
It is clear from the size both the room and its contents that this must
be the chairman's office.  The room measuring about 10 times 8 yards
contains nothing of excess, but the stuff that has been placed here
is of extraordinary quality and must surely have costed many a tellers
wages.  Right in front of you completly dominating the room is a large
mahogny desk which is one of the bigger you have seen.  Right behind it
placed up to the wall is a cupboard which in quality and splendor must
have been made by Chippendale himself.  More descretely in one corner
an inviting sitting-group almost begs you to take a seat.
To the south an opening leads into the tellers' room.

Dark and Drafty Chamber^
You have entered a dark and drafty chamber.  The draft is not that
strong here, but that is because this chamber is much bigger than the
narrow tunnel you used to get here.
This chamber is nearly pitch dark, but a few sunbeams manage to get
through a crystal grating in the ceiling.  The grating is just
reachable but the size of it prevents you from climbing through it when opened.
Worth noticing are the extremely dark walls of this chamber.  It is as
if they are made of lightabsorbing material.
There is an exit to the south and another exit into a pitch dark
chamber to the east.

You are in at a dead end of a small cave.  Right there in front of you on the

see nothing but darkness.  
There is an exit leading west into a pitch dark chamber.
