%locations

S_Cave e:pass2@blizzard s:^hole_snow_cave;
lflags {}
Snow Cave^
   You are in a glittering ice cave, its floor and walls covered with loose,
deep snow.  The cavemouth is east.
^
G_Hall n:^hole_g_hall s:Palace;
lflags {}
Glittering Hall^
   You are in a glittering hall made entirely of ice.  Multi-hued icicles hang
from the ceiling and the hall seems to be gradually melting!  A slippery path
leads south.
^
Magician e:Palace;
lflags {} 
Magician's Research Room^
   You are in a magician's research room, surrounded by a clutter of useless
equipment. This room is also entirely ice, and to judge from the damp equipment
the roof has melted quite considerably.
   There is a doorway to the east.
^
Palace n:G_Hall e:Throne s:Bedroom w:Magician ;
lflags {}
Ice Palace^
   You are in a huge ice hall forming the center of the ice palace.  Huge
pillars hold up the roof, although small amounts of water now trickle down
them.  Archways lead in all directions.
^
Throne e:^WestIceThrone w:Palace ;
lflags {}
The Ice Throne^
   You are in an icy throne hall covered with many ornate carvings of icy
wastes.  The hall is deserted, and it appears whoever is king of this icy
domain is absent.  To the west is the main hall.
^
Bedroom n:Palace s:^cupboard_bedroom;
lflags {}
Royal Bedroom^
   You are in the royal bedroom.  The bed appears to have melted.  There is a
large cupboard on the south wall and a doorway to the north.
^
Store n:^cupboard_store;
lflags {}
The Secret Store Room^
   You are in a secret room.  The thick stone walls are damp and the room
smells musty and unpleasant.  There is a cupboard on the north wall.
^
Cave n:Home s:Tunnel w:^EastIceThrone;
lflags {}
The Cave of the Ice People^
   You are standing in a vast icy cave.  Ice covers the floor, making your
balance precarious at best.  Judging from the footprints, however, it seems
others have been here before you and safely traversed this slippery surface.
A message carved into one wall reads "We Always Bit Chips."
   Passages lead in all directions, but the exit leading east is blocked by
a standard AberMUD construction sign.
^
Home s:Cave;
lflags {Private, Party}
Home of the Iceman^
   Welcome to Iceman's private cubicle.  Despite the icy surroundings, you feel
warm and safe here.  Some of the Iceman's robes are hanging in a closet, along
with some impressive weapons you dare not touch.  On his desk you see some
scrolls covered with Nordic runes, and an unfinished supper, indicating the
Iceman has only stepped out for a moment.  You notice several copies of "Teach
Yourself Swedish" in the bookcase, but one seems to be missing.  A portrait of
his beautiful wife, Lady Galadriel, adorns the otherwise bare walls.
   A single exit leads south.
^
Tunnel n:Cave s:N_Tunnel;
lflags {}
Ice Tunnel^
   You find yourself walking in a well lit tunnel with ice covered walls,
ceiling, and floor.  In addition to the frozen footprints of the Ice People you
also make out some hoofprints.  The tunnel continues to the south.  An exit to
the north leads to the relative safety of a great hall.
^
N_Tunnel n:Tunnel s:Pool;
lflags {}
Narrow Ice Tunnel^
   The tunnel tapers down considerably here, and you must crawl on all fours
to squeeze by.  To the north the tunnel widens out.  You can hear the faint
chirping and buzzing of magical critters emanating from a small hole to the
south.
^
Pool n:N_Tunnel e:Hall;
lflags {}
Crystal Pool^
   You stand in awe in a vast cave dominated by a crystal pool.  The surface of
the water is a perfect mirror, casting silvery reflections on the walls.  Magic
fills the air, and in the water there are manatees and manatoos.  Dewdrops
glisten on the rocks and edelweiss grow in the most unlikely places, among
stones and unfinished ice sculptures.
^
Gambling e:Pool;
lflags {}
Gambling Hall^
   This room is all but magical and wondrous: Cheap decor covers the grimy
walls, smoke fills the air, and the smell isn't exactly winter fresh.  Broken
glass is scattered on the floor, along with some playing cards and dice.  If
your mother knew you were here, she'd be shocked.
^
Hall n:^Door1StChamber w:Pool ;
lflags {}
Hall Of The Ice People^
   This is the great Hall Of The Ice People.  This is where they come to eat,
to drink, and to be merry.  Carvings on the walls tell fascinating sagas of the
giant Thrym and Mjolnir, of the ship Skidbladnir and Ragnarok, and of the One
Tree, Yggdrasil.  The hall is deserted now, and you wonder where everyone is
hiding.  There is some sort of door in the northern wall.
^
Storage s:^Door2StChamber;
lflags {}
Storage Chamber^
   This is just a small store room, filled with empty crates and boxes, some
marked 'Fragile' and others 'Feel Free to Shake and Break'.  There is a single
doorway in the south wall.
