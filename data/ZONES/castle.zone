Leap n:Npath@Valley s:Path w:Watch ;
lflags {}
Bugiit's Leap^
   You stand at the top of a tall cliff looking north, down into a deep valley.
Huge rocks at the bottom offer the delights of total oblivion, to become just
another smashed wreck at its base.
   If you are in no hurry, a narrow cliff path also leads down to the north
descending down a fissure in the cliff itself.
   To the south a path runs towards a large castle with a threatening black
tower, while to the west is an old watchtower.
^
Watch e:Leap d:Leap ;
lflags {}
The Ruined Watchtower^
   You stand in the burnt out ruins of an old stone watchtower.  Soot and moss
cover the blackened crumbling stones.  A single narrow set of steps wind down
and east back to the path.
^
Path n:Leap s:Walls ;
lflags {Outdoors NoMobiles}
Long and Winding Path^
   You are following a north-south path, which links the cliff edge with a
large stone castle, out of which rises a black tower which glitters with the
light, and from stored magical energy, some of which illuminates the very top
of the tower with a bright, golden light.
^
Walls n:Path s:^Port_Outside;
lflags {Outdoors}
Castle Walls^
   You stand at the walls of a large castle, out of which looms up a large
tower, crackling with magical energy.  From here the castle looks deserted,
but you can't be sure.
   The path leads back north, and the main archway into the castle is south.
^
Court n:Port e:Stables s:O_Hall w:Guard;
lflags {}
The Central Courtyard^
   You stand in the central courtyard of a huge and ancient castle.  Flickering
torches, set high around the walls, illuminate even the darkest corners with a
reddish flickering glow.  A huge archway leads north, its sides carved with
fantastic images of dragons and fables.  Arched entryways lead south, east and
west.
^
O_Hall n:Court e:S_Hall s:Sanctum w:Tax;
lflags {}
The Outer Hall^
   You stand in the shadowy outer hall, lit only by flaming torches high out of
reach on the walls.  The dim flickering light illuminates the many doorways
which lead north, south, east and west.
   A cold draught blows through the hall, from the grand, heavily carved
archway, which looks out northwards across the courtyard, its high thick walls
silhouetted in the torch light.
^
S_Hall s:^Door_Golem w:O_Hall;
lflags {}
Side Hall^
   You stand in a small gloomy hall, just east of the outer hall.  All around
you the walls seem to glow with magical power.  You sense that maybe all is not
as meets the eye.
   A single exit leads back west.
^
Sanctum n:O_Hall s:Chamber;
lflags {}
Inner Sanctum^
   This is the stately room where the Lords and Ladies of court would wait to
be entertained by the King of the Castle, although now the tapestries hang in
shreds on the walls and all the treasures that once stood on pedestals have
been smashed or stolen... it would appear that the castle has been raided and
the King overthrown.
   Archways lead north and south.
^
Tax e:O_Hall;
lflags {}
Tax Room^
   This would appear to be the room where the taxes for the surrounding area
were collected and counted, although not stored here, as you yourself found it
so easy to get in.
^
Chamber n:Sanctum e:Torture s:^Castle_Throne w:Kitchens;
lflags {}
King's Chamber^
   You find yourself in a large chamber used for the King and his court to be
entertained in all day and feast in at night, although it looks like the last
feast had a main course with more bite than usual!  Splendid archways lead
north, east and west.
^
Port n:^Port_Inside s:Court;
lflags {}
Portcullis^
   You stand in a large archway which leads out onto a path to the north, and
south back into the courtyard of the castle.  Above you lies the complicated
pulley system used to operate the portcullis.
^
Stables w:Court;
lflags {}
Stables^
   You are standing in the stables for the castle, and from the floor you can
tell that they have been in use recently.
   A strong wind gusts through the open doorway to the west.
^
Escape n:^Escape_Throne;
lflags {}
Escape Passage^
   This is a passageway which would be used by the King and his court if the
castle defense was ever penetrated, to escape from the attackers, and looking
at the lack of dust and cobwebs it would seem to have been used recently.  The
passage is small and dark, but probably more inviting than the wrong end of a
sword.
   At the end of the passage is a sparkling portal which would lead to Xanadu,
but is currently closed for contruction.
^
Kitchens e:Chamber d:Store ;
lflags {}
Kitchens^
   You are standing in the large kitchens for the castle where the daily feasts
were prepared for court.  The place is now in disarray, with tables and cooking
utensils scattered all over the floor.  Exits lead east, or down some stairs
into the cellar.
^
Store u:Kitchens;
lflags {}
Kitchens' Store Room^
   You are in a large and dry store room for the food and drink needed to keep
the King happy.  It seems to have escaped the attention of the attackers, as
the stores are intact, but out of reach.   A set of narrow steps lead up.
^
Torture e:^Maiden w:Chamber;
lflags {}
Torture Chamber^
   You are standing in a pleasant torture chamber which would appear to have
been in regular use as not a single implement lies rusted.  Many implements of
torture lie about the room with various pieces of anatomy still attached to
some of them.
   A single doorway leads west.
^
Guard e:Court ;
lflags {}
Guard Room^
   You find yourself in the guard room for the castle.  Bunks line the walls,
and weapon racks stand in the center of the room, though they are all empty
now.  Judging by the upturned tables and chairs and the dried blood on the
floor you think that the guards may not have left on a Sunday afternoon stroll.
   A single narrow doorway leads east.
^
Maiden  w:^In_Maiden;
lflags {NoSummon, OnePerson}
Inside the Iron Maiden^
   You appear to be inside the Iron Maiden, an ancient form of torture, and you
notice how good the fit is...
