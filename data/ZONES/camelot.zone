You stand in the entrance to the fabled castle of Camelot, seat of

The walls are covered with tapestries showing the valor and chivalry

Banners displaying the coats of arms of King Arthur's knights hang

The Camelot Armory^
Racks of unfinished weapons and armor fill the room, while one entire

the pursuit of their craft. The heat here is incredible, and you
marvel that the smiths are able to work so hard in such heat.

Although the entire room is filled with wonders, your eyes are drawn
again and again to the mighty war banner of King Arthur, hanging on
the wall behind his throne. The dragon, worked in gold thread,
ripples as a draft moves the cloth, and it seems to you that it is
almost alive, ready to spring down from it's perch to defend it's master.

Before you stands the legendary round table of King Arthur. Behind
each of the chairs hangs a portrait of an honored Knight. Looking at
the portraits, you can see honor and chivalry in their eyes. All but

his eyes you see only a cold calculating evil.
