still resides in the caves to the west, lording over the land he helped
destroy.  The other, a deathless lich, was forced to flee.  It is rumored

EForest e:Passage s:Thorny w:Glade n:sherwood1@sherwood;
lflags { OutDoors }
The Elven Forest^
   You stand at the entrance of what was once a grand elven forest.  Now, it
lies in ruins about you.  Blackened stumps abound and the trees which still
stand reek of decay.  This secluded vale has obviously been destroyed by some
great disaster.  You are overcome by a sense of foreboding! The evil which
ruined this forest may still be around!
   Although deeply disturbed by the destruction around you, you manage to look
about to determine your position.  To the North and East are the mountains
which shield this valley.  The area to the South of you also heads into
mountains, but a path makes passage possible.  An archway marks a tunnel
through the eastern mountains.
^
Home e:Cottage s:Path;
lflags { OutDoors }
Forest Home^
   You have entered a small forested area of great beauty, in sharp contrast
to the destruction to the south.  About you, the sounds of nature abound.  If
not for the memory of the tainted forest to the south, you could become easily
lost in the beauty here.  Just to the East of you, partially hidden by healthy
trees, is a small cottage.  To the North and West are the mountains which
seclude this valley.
^
Cottage w:Home;
lflags { Party }
Dinthiar's Cottage^
   You have entered the home of Dinthiar, the Elven King.  It is a rather
simple dwelling.  A bed, table and chair are the only furnishings.  However,
the whole room is given a 'foresty' feel by the ivy which grows up the insides
of the walls, and by the potted plants which hang from the ceiling.  It is
exactly the type of dwelling that you would expect an elf to have.
^
Path n:Home s:Glade;
lflags { OutDoors }
Forest Path^
   You are walking down a forest path which seems less corrupted than the
surrounding areas.  Some wildlife still lives, and the trees are not rotting or
dead.  You see some of the beauty which once existed in this realm.  To the
north of you lies more vibrant forest, while to the south you see only
destruction.
^
Glade n:Path e:EForest s:Shattered w:Glen;
lflags { OutDoors }
Ruined Glade^
   You are in a small clearing in the ruins of the elven forest.  The ground in
this clearing is blackened and infertile.  The only sign of life here is a
circle of toadstools which lie near the center of the glade.  All around you
is ruined forest.  Just to the North, however, you think you see some greenery.
^
Glen e:Glade s:Oaks;
lflags { OutDoors }
Warped Glen^
   You have wandered into a small glen which is grotesquely warped.  Trees
form weird, diabolical shapes, and the area seems pervaded by the stench of
brimstone.  You gag to avoid breathing the fouled air.  To the North and West
are the mountains which shield this valley.  It is quite unfortunate that they
did no protect the forest from whatever destroyed it...
^
Oaks n:Glen e:Shattered  s:Tainted w:Freshly;
lflags { OutDoors }
Blackened Oaks^
   Your heart skips a beat as you enter this grove of trees.  Without a doubt,
this grove used to contain some of the strongest and most beautiful trees in
the entire elven forest.  Now, it looks as though a giant hand came down from
the heavens, and simply pushed the trees down, in a line from West to East.
The few Oaks which still stand have been warped into unhealthy shapes, which
nature itself could never produce.  Following the line of downed trees, you
realize that it leads to a freshly hewn pathway in the mountains to the West.
^
Shattered n:Glade e:^tree s:Corrupted w:Oaks;
lflags { OutDoors }
Shattered Forest^
   You cry out in horror as you witness what has been done to this forest.  All
about, trees lie downed, as if hewn by some giant axe.  However, even the
twisted corpses of the trees seem unnatural.  Somehow, a single oak tree in
the center of the swath of destruction seems to have survived.  It lies just
to the east of you.  To the west, the line of destruction seems to continue.
Mercifully, mountains to the east protected any further realms from this
corruption.
^
Inside w:^door;
lflags {}
Inside the Grand Oak^
   You gasp out in awe at the quiet beauty of this hidden hollow.  Looking
around, 'majesty' is the word which immediately comes to mind.  The entire
room draws your eyes upwards, like some ancient gothic cathedral. There, among
the arched, wooden roof, are numerous tiny flowers, hanging from the vines
which grow around you. Even in the dim light, the brilliant hues of the
flowers - red, violet, blue, green, and white - stand out. Indeed, they glow
with their own light, providing the majority of the illumination in this room
and sending incredible, multi-colored shadows around the room. As you stare at
them, something tugs at your memory. You have seen that pattern somewhere
before... It is the pattern of the stars in the night sky, but of a color and
brightness that the night sky can only hint at.
   As your eyes slowly refocus on the mundane plane, you notice a wooden
throne set near the middle of this room.  With a start, you realize that is
has been grown from the tree itself.  Once, the whole elven forest must have
been like this...
^
Tainted n:Oaks e:Corrupted;
lflags { OutDoors }
Tainted Trees^
   You are in a grove of tall trees which seem tainted.  They glow with a
sickly green glow which speaks of evil, pestilence and disease.  You suppress
a shudder and view your surroundings.  To the south and west lie this forest's
protective mountains, while woods lie to the east.  To the North, a wide swath
of destructions cuts into the heart of this realm.
^
Corrupted n:Shattered e:Scenic w:Tainted;
lflags { OutDoors }
Corrupted Woods^
   You stand in what must have once been a very beautiful grove of trees.  Now,
it has been mutated beyond recognition.  The grotesque shapes of the trees are
all but indescribable.  You get the impression that this forest has been
destroyed by some great, evil force which may still lurk about...
^
Scenic n:Thorny s:Climb w:Corrupted;
lflags { OutDoors }
Scenic View^
   Once, this mountain trail surely was the best place to view the elven
forest.  Now, you can only see the destruction.  To the North and West,
you gaze out at the corrupted, desolate land which was once so beautiful.
Amid the destruction, you see a few points of life.  Just to the Northeast
of you stands a tall, healthy oak tree, while further to the North, you
actually think you see green.  The mountain trail you are on continues North
and South, while a small path leads up from the forest to the West.
^
Climb n:Scenic e:Crest;
lflags { OutDoors }
Rocky Climb^
   You are walking on a steep mountain path which leads over the top of the
mountain to the east and downwards towards a ravaged forest to the North.
You suspect that the view here would be quite beautiful if not for the noxious
fumes wafting up from the forest below, which cause your eyes to constantly
water.  Looking at the forest, you believe that it must have once been quite
beautiful.
^
Thorny n:EForest e:^thorns s:Scenic;
lflags { OutDoors }
Thorny Path^
   You are ascending a path into the mountains, which continues to the North
and South.  The region seems just as desolate as the forest below you.  The
ground is cracked and dying, and the only vegetation is a thorny brush, which
practically cover the path, ripping at your clothes.  The entire Eastern cliff
is covered by a wall of thorns.  On the other side, just to the West is a
sharp dropoff.  Past it, you can see the entire elven forest.  The corrupted
view turns your stomach.
^
Passage e:NWcorner@valley w:EForest;
lflags { NoMobiles }
Mountain Passage^
   You are walking down a long passage which has been carved out of the heart
of this mountain.  It is obvious that great time has been spent carving this
passage.  You have heard rumors of the dwarves of the North cutting a passage
through to a beautiful forest for the elves of this realm.  Perhaps, that
beautiful, fabled realm lies to the West!
^
Freshly e:Oaks w:Cave;
lflags { OutDoors }
Freshly Hewn Pathway^
   You stand in a pathway which is quite freshly-hewn.  From the marks made
during the construction of this pathway, it seems that something moved out
into the forest from the west.  To the west, the stench of brimstone is
stronger than ever.
^
Crest e:RClearing@valley w:Climb;
lflags { OutDoors NoMobiles }
Mountain Crest^
   You stand at the top of one of the mountains overlooking the valley.  Just
to the east, the path you are on becomes rather precarious, sloping sharply
down into a rocky clearing.  To the west, the descent is more gradual, ending
in a rocky slope.  You should be very careful.  It looks like the area could
all tumble down in a landslide in a second!
^
Cave e:Freshly w:Entry;
lflags {}
Guarded Cave^
   You stand at the entrance to a dark cave.  The destroyed forest is behind
you, to the east, while to the west lies the unknown.  Within the cave,
you see dark shadows flittering about.  The scent of brimstone is stronger
than ever here, and the sense of foreboding that you felt when you first
entered the forest clutches anew at you heart.  You have little doubt that
one of the great evils lies within this cave...
^
Entry n:Coat e:Cave d:Guard;
lflags {}
Entry Room^
   Standing at the entrance to this system of caves, the only description
which comes to mind is 'hellish.'  The caverns glow with a strange red
glow which speaks of nothing more than hellfire.  It almost seems to you that
you can hear the screams of the damned.  A set of stairs leads downwards,
and the heat coming from below almost knocks you out.  Just to the North is
a roughly carved doorway.  Next to the door is a sign which says : Please
check in your souls before entering.
^
Coat s:Entry;
lflags {}
Coat Room^
   With a morbid sense of curiosity, you enter the cave where you have been
directed in order to check your soul.  Quite surprisingly, you are not
instantly zapped by some evil being.  Instead, the room seems to a quite
simple coat room.  Lining the walls are coats of every shape and size, checked
in, no doubt, due to the heat below. You would laugh at how ridiculous this
whole seen looked if not for the evil that you feel below you.
^
Guard e:^Edoor s:Treasury u:Entry;
lflags {}
Guard Room^
   The heat in this room is stifling.  As you struggle to breath the scalding
air, you manage to take in the surroundings.  All about, you can see squalor.
A broken tables lies off to one corner, with the remnants of a meal, ages old
on it, and several broken chairs litter the floor.  The room itself actually
reeks of garbage, and covering the walls are a dried up substance that looks
suspicious like blood.  A crudely letter sign on the wall reads GARD ROME.
To the South is an archway that seems to lead into a somewhat cleaner room.
^
Treasury n:Guard;
lflags {}
Demon Treasury^
   This room seems to be somewhat cleaner than the guard room to the North, but
not much.  The same reek of garbage pervades the air, and piles of litter have
been shoved to the sides of the room.  However, in the center of the room is
a wooden pedestal which has been polished to perfection, and which is
exceedingly clean.  You have come through the only entrance to this room.
^
Stairs w:^Wdoor d:Hot;
lflags {}
Stairs to Hades^
   You have no doubt in your mind that the stairs in the middle of this room
must go down to hell itself.  If you thought the earlier rooms were hot, you
were obviously sadly mistaken.  Here, every breath you take burns your lungs.
Your skin is already beginning to blister from the intense heat, and you are
worried that your clothing may spontaneously combust!  As well, flames appear
in the corners of this room and the smell of brimstone is so strong that it
makes you want to vomit immediately.  Surely, nothing but Hades itself could
lie in the Inferno below...
^
Hot e:Museum s:Fungus w:^hole u:Stairs;
lflags {}
Hot Cavern^
   You stand in a huge, natural cavern.  It is not just hot, but rather
almost unbearable.  There certainly better be something valuable down here
to make all of your suffering okay!  To the south of you is another natural
cavern, while to the east lies a passage which is obviously manmade.  Just
to the west is a stone door, set in the wall of the cavern.  A diamond shaped
hole lies in the center of the stone.
^
Museum n:Hate e:Mosaic s:Art w:Hot;
lflags {}
Demonic Museum^
   You have entered what could only be a demonic museum.  All about you are
statues and paintings, most of which are quite grotesque.  You see sculptures
of demons torturing humans in many gruesome ways, as well as paintings of what
must be Hades.  The whole site is quite sickening.  Doors lead North, East and
South into additional museum rooms, while to the west lies the exit to this
perverted place.
^
Mosaic w:Museum;
lflags {}
Mosaic Room^
   The entirity of this room is covered by a huge mosaic.  It covers all of
the walls, as well as the ceiling and the floor.  You realize immediately that
the area shown in the mosaic is that which mortals call the wasteland.  You see
images of fire, a sword of awesome power, crystal flame and a great djinni.
For a moment, you almost become lost in the awesome vision.
   Flaming red letters in the center of the room spell out the words, HOME,
SWEET, HOME.
^
Art n:Museum;
lflags {}
Art Gallery^
   This part of the Demonic museum seems to be entirely devoted to demonic art.
The pieces are all quite horrific, and there is definitely nothing that would
be valuable to sacrifice to the gods.  You are almost drawn by a morbid
curiosity to look at all of the terrifying pictures.  The only exit out of
this awful place lies to the North.
^
Fungus n:Hot s:Lake;
lflags { Dark }
Fungus Cavern^
   You are quite delighted to find that this cavern is much cooler than the
surrounding ones.  In fact, the change in temperature is so dramatic that
you begin to shiver uncontrollably.  All about this room are various types of
fungus.  You can make out familiar Toadstools and Mushrooms.  In addition, you
see more much exotic fungus that you have never encountered before.  Perhaps,
you think, you are the only mortal to ever have ventured this far into the
earth. Other natural caverns lie to the North and South.
^
Lake n:Fungus d:^lake;
lflags { Dark }
Large Lake^
   Although not as cool as the marvelous fungus cavern, this room is much more
comfortable than the surrounding caves.  In the center of this cavern is a
large lake.  Looking over the walls, you notice strange writing.  To you, it
almost looks like elven writing, somehow corrupted.  Overall, the entire
cavern seems quite gloomy.  You better leave this place before you get real
depressed!
^
Hate s:Museum;
lflags {}
Hate Gallery^
   All throughout this room are paintings of a gruesome undead beast.  Without
a doubt, it must be the Lich who, when fighting Asmodeus, was rumored to have
helped cause the destruction of the elven forest.  The fact that the Lich is
an enemy of the demon lord here is made quite clear by the voice you hear
chanting in your head.  Over and over, you hear 'hate. hate. hate. hate...'
^
Boiling n:Stone e:^StoneDoor;
lflags {}
Boiling Lake^
   You have entered another natural cavern.  In the middle of the cavern is a
huge lake.  Indeed, the scene would appear to be quite normal if not for the
fact that lake was actually boiling.  It has become so hot in this room that
water itself is unable to remain in its liquid form!  Surely, you must escape
this demonic realm soon!  Avenues of retreat from here lie to the North and
East.
^
Stone n:Throne s:Boiling;
lflags {}
Stone Room^
   You stand in a perfectly cubical room, obviously not natural.  What makes
the room eerie is the fact that no signs of construction are visible.  It is
almost as if the entire room sprung from the earth in its present shape.  To
the South you hear the sounds of liquid boiling, while to the north, beyond
a perfect archway, you see what looks like a throne room.
^
Den n:Asmodeus e:Throne s:Bedroom;
lflags {}
The Den^
   You have entered Asmodeus' study.  In the center of the room is a desk,
which you realize is covered with human skin.  Putting that thought out of
your mind you look around the rest of the room.  The walls are made of the
red rock that is common throughout the caves and the smell of sulphur, like
always, all but overwhelms you.  Still, your eyes keep returning to that
gruesome desk.  Looking for exits to this room, you find three.  They lie to
the North, East and South.
^
Throne s:Stone w:Den;
lflags {}
Throne Room^
   You have entered the throne room of Asmodeus, the Demon Lord who, in his
battle with the evil lich, destroyed the beautiful elven forest.  If that foul
creature is still around, he must be destroyed!  You rapidly glance around the
room and see, in the middle of the room, a throne made out of human bones.
You gag at the sight, and rapidly look for exits from this room.  They lie
to the South and West.
^
Bedroom n:Den;
lflags {}
Asmodeus' Bedroom^
   You realize that this must be what the demonlord calls a bedroom.  It is
little more than a space of level rock in the center of the room.  Asmodeus
obviously worries little about the ordinary comforts of life.  At the least,
this room is not as grotesque as the study that you just passed through.
^
Asmodeus s:Den;
lflags {}
Asmodeus' Treasury^
   You have entered the treasury of the vile demon-lord, Asmodeus.  In the
corner of this room sits an easy chair.  Without a doubt, Asmodeus would spend
long hours in here, simply counting his treasures.  You grin evilly at the
thought of stealing from a demon lord.
^
Entrance e:Cathedral w:^ThornsEast d:Cathedral;
lflags {}
The Cave Entrance^
   You stand at the entrance to what appears to be a vast system of caves.  A
cool breeze strikes you in the face as you peer ahead into the blackness, and
you sense strong evil emanating from the cavern.  To the west, you see the
blackened mouth of the cave, to the east, a downward sloping passage leads to
darkness.
^
Cathedral n:Narrow e:EastEnd u:Entrance;
lflags { Dark }
Cathedral Room^
   You are in a vast cavern.  The ceiling is lost in shadows, but you can make
out a ledge encircling the room.  Evenly spaced along the ledge are stone
gargoyles, which seem to be jeering at you.  In the wall far to the north, you
see the black mouth of a passage out, and the room seems to continue to the
east, where dim light can be made out.  To the south, an upward sloping passage
seems to ascend to the surface.
^
EastEnd n:Planning w:Cathedral d:^Throne_Cathedral;
lflags {}
East End of the Cathedral^
   You are now in the eastern section of the cathedral.  A subdued glow
emanates from a phosphorescent moss lining the walls and ceiling.  Against
the far eastern wall is a large throne hewn from granite.  A thick layer
of dust covers everything.  To the north, a passage leads to a small, brightly
lit room.
^

   You have walked into a small stone cubical acting as a storage room.  The
walls are lined with wooden shelves.  A large door is located on the east
wall.

Captain's Office^
   You are standing in a sparsely furnished office.  Sputtering torches
provide light, but many shadows still abound.  The main piece of furniture
is a large oak desk in the center of the room.  A large door is in the
west wall, and a passageway leads to the east.

Planning Room^
   You enter a large room which is almost entirely filled by a huge table.
Upon the table sit little miniature figures, arrayed as if for combat.  You
can vaguely make out a label on one particularly ugly demon which says
Asmodeus.  Obviously, the Lich plans his grand wars here.
^
Interrogation e:Lich;
lflags { Dark }
Interrogation Room^
   You have entered a room obviously designed to force people to talk and
give great pain.  A lingering smell of death and decay fills the room.
Various instruments of torture fill the room, the most notable being a
large rack in the center.  The only exit from the room leads to the east.
^

   You are in a dank, moldy prison.  Something that looks suspiciously like

   You are in a passage worn through the years by the passing of many feet.
To the west, you see a small room, and the passage continues to the south.
To the north, the passage opens into what appears to be a guardroom, and the
slow movements of zombies can be heard coming from it.

that you are in some type of bed room.  Evil religious icons and grotesque
paintings line the walls.  In the corner sits an altar which is covered by
a dark red liquid.  Without a doubt, this is the home of the Priest of the
dark elves.

   You stand in the treasury of this grand dark elven temple.  This side
room is just as beautiful, in its dark, alluring way, as the main worship

   You have emerged into the largest subterranean cavern that you have ever
seen.  Above you, the roof lies somewhere beyond the radius of your light
source, while to the sides of this cavern, you can just barely make out the
walls.  Most astounding is a temple lying in the center of this cavern, which
has apparently been constructed entirely underground!  The temple is made out
of some type of dark stone which glows with an unholy black light.  Without
a doubt, this temple is dedicated to some dark deity.  You may enter it to the
North.  Off to the east and south lie other exits from this cavern.

Temple Guard Room^
   You stand in the room which housed the two dark elves who guarded the
temple.  It is a rather dark and dreary.  On the ground lie two worn mattresses
while a wobbly table stands to the side.

Commander's Quarters^
   You stand in a large, well-kept room.  It has none of the squalor of the
barracks to the East.  There is a neat bed here, with a tidy table next to.
If it weren't for the fact everything in this room was black, the place might
actually look cheery.

Elven Barracks^
   You are in a large barracks for the dark elf troops.  The whole place seems
run down.  Trash litters the floor and most of the beds in this room are
destroyed.  It looks as if, for the most part, the dark elves do not bother
to maintain an army now that their enemies, the good elves above, are gone.
Exits leave these barracks to the West and East.

Cavern of the Dark Elves^
   You have entered an enormous cavern.  You are awed by the vastness of this
room.  As you acclimate to this dark, damp environment, you remember of the
ancient legends you have heard of a dark race of elves living below the
surface.  Surely, this is their realm!  Looking around you, this assumption
is upheld by the many dark shapes you see moving in the shadows.  You should
move through these realms quickly.  Surely the dark shapes would overwhelm
you by numbers if you stayed here too long.  Exits leave this cavern to the
North, West, South and East, while a ladder leads up.

Glowing Passage^
   You walk down a passage which curves to the West and South.  The passage
is lit by an eerie green glow which seems to come from fungus growth on the
walls.  Ever once in a while, you think you see a dark shape at the edge of
your vision, but then it could just be your imagination.

Fungoid Cavern^
   You stand in an enormous cavern which seems to be wall-to-wall fungus.
Besides mushrooms and other common fungus, you also see many unusual ones,
much as in the fungus cavern above.  As well, the green fungus from the
the passageway to the North may be seen.

Captain's Quarters^
   You stand in a large room which seems to have been well kept.  It has none
of the squalor of the barracks to the North.  There is a neat bed here, as
well as an organized desk.  However, the entire room is covered by a layer of
dust. Obviously, these quarters have not been used for quite some time.  The
only exit is to the North.

Long Ladder^
   You are midway up a very long ladder.  It seems rather damp as if water
constantly dripped on it.  You think you can manage to keep a grip on the
ladder which extends far above and below you.
