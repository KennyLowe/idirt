Top of Spiral Staircase^

the gloom of below.  From down there come strange sounds, which you cannot

Spiral Staircase^
   You are on a spiral staircase, and you are not far from the top of it.
Below you it is cold and gloomy, although not yet dark enough to need a light.

Spiral Staircase^
   You are on a spiral staircase which decends into a blanket of mist.  It
also (for the uninitiated in spiral staircase design) carries on upwards.

   As you stand here a blanket of mist envelopes you.  The only ways out are to
grope upwards or downwards.

Spiral Staircase^
   The staircase you are on ascends upwards into a blanket of mist or downwards
into a large labyrinth of columns, which, from your view point, appears to be
endless.

The Start of the Labyrinth^
   ...is a boring sort of place, the only exits being up a spiral staircase and
east into the Labyrinth.  The Labyrinth itself is composed of tall pillars in
the gloom.  There is a message scratched in the dirt here.  It says:
