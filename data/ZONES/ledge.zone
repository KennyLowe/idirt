On e:Cavemouth w:^RopeWest;
lflags{Outdoors}
On The Ledge^
   You are standing on a narrow ledge high up the side of some steep cliffs.
The ledge continues west beside a narrow cavemouth.  To the east the ledge ends
some twenty feet short of a set of steps, which climb up the cliff side from
the valley below.
^
Cavemouth n:Cave e:Ledge w:On;
lflags{Outdoors}
Cavemouth^
   You are standing on a narrow precipitous ledge.  The ledge runs east-west,
and to the north a narrow cavemouth leads into semi-darkness.  Braving vertigo,
you gaze over the lip of the ledge across the vast expanse of trees far below.
^
Ledge e:Death w:Cavemouth;
lflags{Outdoors}
Ledge^
   The ledge narrows here, become only a couple of inches wide as it leads
further eastwards.  To the west the ledge widens out.
^
Death ;
lflags{Outdoors Death}
Ledge^
   Your feet slip on the dangerously thin ledge, and you plunge rapidly
downwards to your death...
^
Cave n:Pit e:Tunnel s:Cavemouth;
lflags{}
Narrow Cave^
   You are standing in a long narrow cave.  Dim and pallid light shines in from
the cavemouth to the south, illuminating passageways north and east.
^
Tunnel e:^TunnWest w:Cave;
lflags{}
Narrow Tunnel^
   You are clambering along a narrow slanted passage.  Rubble and loose stones
rain down around you as you move, suggesting the roof is not very strong. Light
shines along the passage from a junction to the west.
^
Forgotten w:^TunnEast;
lflags{}
Forgotten Place^
   You are standing in a dim forgotten place, deep underground.  The rocks
around you seem placid and silent, as if in silent contemplation of some deeper
more ancient power of the earth.
^
Pit s:Cave u:^RopeBotPit;
lflags{Outdoors}
Bottom Of Pit^
   You are standing at the bottom of a huge open pit.  The pit walls are almost
sheer, and well beyond climbing.  A narrow tunnel leads south into shadow.
