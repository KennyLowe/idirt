lflags {}
Churchyard^
   You stand in what is apparently an old and disused churchyard.  Weeds and
moss cover the crumbling gravestones and paths.  To the east is a huge ancient
church, now decaying and surrounded by bits of fallen stonework.  To the north
the graveyard continues.
^
Entry e:Church2 w:C_Yard ;
lflags {}
Arched Entry^
   You stand in what must have once been a magnificent arched entrance, with
huge oak doors, and a carved doorway fit for a palace.  Now however the doors
lie in rotting pieces on the floor, and rain drips down the moss covered
stonework.
^
Church1 e:Decaying s:Church2 ;
lflags {}
North End Of Church^
   You stand at the north end of the church, looking south down between the
silent rows of rotting pews.  Another doorway leads east into a small room.
^
Decaying w:Church1 ;
lflags {}
A Decaying Room^
   You stand in a decaying room, the stone walls and floor are soaked with damp
and whatever used to be stored in here has long since rotted away.  The timbers
of the roof above you now sag dangerously and the whole room smells of rot.  A
single doorway leads west.
^
Church2 n:Church1 s:Altar w:Entry ;
lflags {}
The Church^
   You stand in the center of the now battered and dilapidated church.  Water
runs down the walls, dripping in pools onto the rotting remains of the pews.
The church extends northwards, and southward towards the altar.  To the west is
the exit.
^
Altar n:Church2 e:Stairs1 s:Behind ;
lflags {}
By The Altar^
   You are standing beside the altar, now barely recognizable, a smashed and
aged pile of rotten wood and fabrics, hiding mossy stonework beneath.  A set of
steps lead up to the east, probably to the church tower.  The main church hall
is north, and to the south you can go behind the altar.
^
Stairs1 s:Bell w:Altar u:Stairs2 d:Crypt@Catacomb ;
lflags {}
Stairs^
   You stand on a set of slippery stone steps which lead both downwards and
upwards from here.  Doorways lead south into a small room and west into the
main church hall.
^
Bell n:Stairs1 u:Bells ;
lflags {}
The Bell Room^
   You are standing in a small stone room, which is both wet and cold.  The
wooden roof above you has holes in it through which ropes hang, presumably for
the church bells.  A single doorway leads north.
^
Stairs2 w:Pulpit u:GiveWay d:Stairs1 ;
lflags {}
The Stairs^
   You are climbing a set of steep, slippery stairs that lead up into the
church tower.  Water runs down the steps, collecting in mossy pools, where the
cracks and dips in the stonework allow it.  The steps turn from stone to wood
up above, and look very rickety.
   To the west a doorway leads out into the pulpit.
^
Pulpit e:Stairs2 ;
lflags {}
The Pulpit^
   You stand in the rotting remains of what was the pulpit, looking north along
the length of the church hall, a sorry sight indeed, and also gazing up through
the holes in the roof, skyward.
   A doorway leads east onto some stairs.
^
Tower s:Bells d:GiveWay;
lflags {}
The Tower^
   You stand in the room at the top of the tower.  A set of dangerous looking
steps lead down to the main part of the church.  To the south the room opens up
into a large chamber full of bells.
^
Bells n:Tower d:Bell ;
lflags {}
The Bells, The Bells!!!!^
   You stand in a large chamber packed with bells.  There is a doorway to the
north, or you could shin down a bell rope.
^
G_Yard n:G_Yard2 s:C_Yard w:Gloop ;
lflags {Outdoors}
Graveyard^
   You are standing at the southern end of the graveyard, following a path
which leads north, beside a stone wall.  To the south is the churchyard, and
the old church itself.  To the west a worn rut in the grass leads out across
some marshy ground, past a sign which reads "Danger Marshland".
   A small grave bears the enscription "Orcus: He wasn't nice and paid the
price."
^
G_Yard2 n:Barrow s:G_Yard ;
lflags {Outdoors}
Graveyard^
   You are standing at the southern end of the graveyard.  To the south a path
leads out of the graveyard down towards the church.  To the north are several
barrows.
   A large gravestone bearing the words "The tomb of the unknown coder" catches
your eye.
^
Barrow n:N_Barrow e:T_Barrow s:G_Yard2 ;
lflags {Outdoors}
The Barrow^
   You stand near the top of a large mound. A path leads south back into the
main part of the graveyard, north to another mound and east towards a pillar
set on the top of the mound.
   A small grave bears the words "Anarchy The Wizard (Out for lunch)"
A plaque on the grave reads 'Anarchy The Wizard - slain by the Aberystwyth
rules --- "If you can't pass your physics you can't have your degree.
	   How can you have your degree if you can't pass your physics..."
^
N_Barrow s:Barrow ;
lflags {Outdoors}
The North Barrow^
   You stand on the top of a large mound at the north end of the graveyard.
A path leads back southward.
   On a small gravestone is written "Beware of the Moog".
^
Silent u:^slab_bot;
lflags {}
Silent Room^
   You are standing in a small dark room, beneath the northern barrow.  All
around you lie the relics of an ancient time, crumbling slowly into dust.
Everything is dark and creepy, and the sense of malice and foreboding makes you
jump at the slightest movement in the shadows.  The center of the room is a
tall gravestone bearing the words:
   "White The Wizard - A man pledged never to make his own coffee."
^
T_Barrow w:Barrow d:^slab_top;
lflags {Outdoors}
Top Of Barrow^
   You stand on the top of a huge barrow. A single path leads back to the west.
A huge stone pillar stands on the center of the barrow marked with the words:
		Born To Live
		Bound To Die
		Born To Love
		Bound To Cry
		Born To Win
		Bound To Lose
		Peace At Last
		Death Not Gloom

Gloop^
   You sink into the treacherous marsh with a gloop!

The stairs give way and...^
   ...you fall to your death (what else did you expect to happen?)

Behind The Altar^
   You stand behind the altar looking northwards along the length of the church
which is a very sorry sight indeed, everything wooden is rotting, the stonework
is moss covered, and gaping holes in the roof allow you to look skyward.
