Way Up to the Mountains^
You find yourself on the edge of a vast mountain range. To the east you can
see a large square-shaped clearing. Further east you can see some kind of a
temple while on the north-east on the edge of you sight lies two pyramid-
shaped buildings. Despite the strange looking buildings you find the eastward
path more inviting than the high mountains to the west.

Large Clearing^
You are standing on a large square-shaped clearing. Pieces of old weapons 
and arrowheads on the ground tell you that the grass over here has once been
manured with blood. Nearby to the north you see the San Juan river. Passages 
lead west towards a mountain range and east to a some kind of a street.

Calle de los Muertos^ 
You find yourself on an ancient passageway which seems to have been the 
main street of an old town. The street is wide and paved with large grey 
flagstones. The street leads to the north while the southern way disappears 
under flourishing grass mat. The path to the west leads to a clearing and to 
the east there is a temple.

Overgrown street^
A long time ago this town might have been a major center in this area. However,
time has done its' job and you can hardly discern the pavement under your
feet. The street leads north into the town. To the south there is a swamp 
which does not look very inviting.

The Swamp^
You have entered a large swamp area. Suddenly you find out that you can't 
move your feet any more.

The Swamp Thing rises up from the mud...
You are swallowed by the Swamp Thing...
You are not feeling very good now...

Before the Temple^                    
You are standing on a large opening covered with grass right before a huge
temple to the east. The temple is made of large clay bricks and there is a
stairway leading up to its' top. You see large stone animal figures beside
the stairs. You can still go back west to the street.

You are going your way up the temple stairs sweating and panting. Breathing
deeply you stop and lean against a statue besides the stairs. Examining the 
statue more closely, you figure out that the statue is actually a big head of
a snake decorated with stony feathers. The snake has an evil grin on his face 
and you are glad it is not alive. The stairs lead upwards to the top of the
temple and down back to the clearing.

Quetzalcoatl's Temple^
Looking back down where you came from makes you feel dizzy so you decide 
to pay more attention to a huge monolith laying before you. The monolith 
is four feet high and twelve feet wide. Its' face is smooth, but covered 
with dark red and brown spots all over it. This is probably a place where
the priests of this ancient city used to worship their god of Earth and the 
Universe later known as Quetzalcoatl by the Aztecs. The sight could easily 
turn a flesh-eating beast to a true vegetarian.

You have arrived at a wide stone bridge. The bridge consists of four huge

flagstones quite like the others in the town. The San Juan river flows 
gently under the bridge to the east. You are considering a little refreshing
dive into the river, but as you see all the alligators you think it might
be better to take a boat.

Your heart beats fast and you stop for a while to breath deep and recover

didn't have so much trouble with the gators. You wipe the sweat from your 
forehead and look around. You find yourself in a small room sanctified to 
some god of these unknown people. On the north wall there stands a small 
bronze statue decorated with colorful stones. The statue stands firmly on 
the floor and it's almost impossible to move. The stone decorations, 
however, seem to be quite loose on the statue. Maybe you still can bring
