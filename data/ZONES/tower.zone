Base n:^Door_Tower e:Black;
lflags {}
Base of the Tower^
   You are now inside the black tower which stretches up out of the castle.
The walls glisten with sorcery and from high above come the noises of high
level spells and experimentation.
   A doorway leads east into another room, and a door lies north.
^
Black n:^Shelf w:Base ;
lflags {}
Black Tower^
   You are in a small dark room in one of the lower levels of the black tower.
It appears to be a store room for spell ingredients which line the shelves on
the northern wall.  An archway leads west to the tower entrance.
^
Candle s:^Panel w:Scroll ;
lflags {}
Candle Room^
   This room looks like a cross between a Queen video and Madam Toussaud's
after an arson attack, as candles of all shapes, sizes and colors fill the
room.  A passageway leads west.
^
Scroll e:Candle ;
lflags {}
Scroll Room^
   You are in a large, dry and well lit store room for scrolls, which would
appear to be the Sorceror's supply.
^
Potion s:Spell ;
lflags {}
Potion Store Room^
   This would appear to be the potion preparation and store room for the
Sorceror, as around you lie shelves once lined with glass vials and bottles
ready to be filled.  A single doorway leads south.
^
Spell n:Potion ;
lflags {}
Spell Room^
   This room would appear to be one of the Sorceror's many spell rooms as its
scorched walls show the signs of many a fireball spell or a more dangerous
variant of it.  A single scorched doorway leads north.
^
Magical e:Wraith;
lflags {}
Magical Item Storeroom^
   You are standing in a large storeroom which would be packed with magical
artifacts in normal times but it seems that the Sorceror is using their power
for a large spell project that crackles from the top-most level of the tower.
   A doorway leads through to the east to the wraith room, and you tremble at
the thought of the creature which may lie through it, a creature which has been
known to slay even Enchanters in but a single blow...
^
Wraith n:Levitation w:Magical;
lflags {}
Wraith Room^
   You find yourself in the room where the Sorceror keeps his undead creatures,
in particular his pet Wraith, until he needs them.  Exits lead north and west.
^
Levitation s:Wraith u:Ante;
lflags {}
Levitation Room^
   You find yourself in a completely black room, even light seems afraid to go
here.  It is completely bare of adornment, and even the walls wouldn't stay if
they had somewhere else to lean!
   There is a single exit in the ceiling high above, and another to the south.
You seem to be floating!
^
Ante e:Sorceror d:Levitation ;
lflags {}
Sorceror's Ante-room^
   You are standing in the Sorceror's ante-room, which sizzles with magical
energy.  Apart from the hole in the floor the only exit available is to the
east.
^
Sorceror e:Ledge s:^Door_Shazareth w:Ante;
lflags {}
Sorceror's Room^
   You are in a very large and exceedingly magical room, devoted to the pursuit
of magic in all its form.  Flames dance over the walls to light the scene,
although they are merely for effect as a permanent fire fountain erupts from
the center of the room.  Gargoyles wink at you from the walls and objects move
quietly in complex patterns, getting on with the jobs they have been given.
   There is a door to the south, and a doorway leads west.  A splendid arched
window looks east across the world.
^
Treasure n:^Door_Treasure;
lflags {}
Treasure Chamber^
   This is large treasure store and naturally everything in it belongs to the
Sorceror and might take a rather nasty attitude to being removed.
^
Ledge w:Sorceror;
lflags {}
The Window Ledge^
   You are perched on a precarious window ledge looking down the black tower
into the courtyard below.  The safety (?) of the Sorceror's Room is back west.
^
