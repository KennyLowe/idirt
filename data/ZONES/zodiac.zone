lflags {  }
Among the Stars^

     You find yourself wandering amongst the stars in the infinite night sky.
You're baffled by the incredible size of the area around you...seemingly
endless.  You could easily find yourself lost forever in these timeless 
voids.
^

eastsky n:neastsky s:seastsky e:eastend w:amgstars u:lost1;
lflags {  }
East Sky^

     Looking down to the lands of your birth, you suddenly feel incredibly
homesick, likely due to the enormous distance between you and your family.
To the west you can barely see the tower from which you entered into the 
night sky.  Far to the east you can see the constellations Aries, Leo and
Sagittarius.
^

eastend w:eastsky e:firea u:lost1;
lflags { NoMobiles }
The Far Eastern Sky^
     
     Just to the east you can see the constellations governed by the power
of fire.  They seem to be having a rather heated debate.
^

neastsky s:eastsky n:lost1 e:lost1 w:northsky u:lost1;
lflags {  }
More Stars^

     You realise that you had better not venture too far away from where
you came from, since you could very easily become lost in this area.
^

seastsky n:eastsky s:lost1 e:lost1 w:southsky u:lost1;
lflags {  }
More Stars^

     Peering to the south and to the east you can't seem to see anything
that you'd be able to get to in your lifetime...
^

northsky n:northend s:amgstars e:neastsky w:nwestsky u:lost1;
lflags {  }
The Northern Skies^

     Although your common sense tells you to go back to the south before
you get yourself totally lost, you would much rather continue searching
for whatever is is that you are looking for.
^

northend n:aira s:northsky u:lost1;
lflags { NoMobiles }
The Far Northern Sky^

     Only a little further north you can see the land of clean air.  You
can also see shapes moving about there, but everything about the place seems
friendly enough.
^

swestsky n:westsky s:lost1 w:lost1 e:southsky u:lost1;

     Peering to the south and to the west you can't seem to see anything that

^

southsky n:amgstars s:southend e:seastsky w:swestsky u:lost1;
lflags {  }
The Southern Skies^

     As you scan the area you suddenly feel very lonely.  There is nothing for 
miles if you were to head either east or west. Back to the north is where you
began, and while you think that's probably the best way for you to go, you
have a gut feeling that wants you to go due south.
^

westsky e:amgstars n:nwestsky w:westend s:swestsky u:lost1;
lflags {  }
The Western Skies^

     Just to the east is the way back home, perhaps you should go back that
way?  Looking up you can see forever, and while you realise that forever
means that it's much too big, you still have a very small part of you that
thinks you might find something up there.  It would probably be a better
idea to just stay on the path you were on. 
^

southend n:southsky s:eartha u:lost1;
lflags { NoMobiles }
The Far South^

     You can just barely make out the tower you entered from in the north,
and although it is very far away, you're confident you can make it back
without a problem.  Just to the south you can see some creatures moving
about and you can hear one of them shouting 'Toro, Toro!'.
^

westend w:watera e:westsky u:lost1;
lflags { NoMobiles }
Near the Edge of the West Sky^

     'Not much farther now' you keep telling yourself...and you're right.
The constalations Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces are right after the next
mile-astroid, which you can see from here.

/*  these are the homes of the sun signs  */

firea w:eastend n:aries e:leo s:sagittarius;

Land of Fire^

     A rather desolate place...the grass slowly burns along with several
chunks of fur that leave you to believe that the debate you were listing
to turned rather violent...perhaps a visitor is just what they need?
^

aries s: firea;
lflags {  }
The Cheerful Home of Aries^

     Well...perhaps not so cheerful....the floor is black with ash and the
windows are curtain less.  There is no bed, nor are there any closets,
tables, or chairs.  Nothing about this place is in any way appealing to you,
lest of all the sulphurous stench that shreds at your nostrils.
^

leo w:firea;
lflags {  }
The Lion's Den^

     Nothing seems out of place here, considering that it's owned by Leo the
lion.  A few bones lie scattered about the place, but you would have to have
expected that...perhaps what you didn't expect to see would be either the 
head on the wall, or the rug on the floor.
^

sagittarius n:firea;
lflags { NegRegen }
The Archer's Range^

     This room is about 50 meters in length, with several targets and arrows
lying about.  The grass is mostly burned away, but a few patches of green 
give hope of some life to this place.
^

aira s:northend n:libra e:gemini w:aquarius;
lflags {  }
The Fresh Air^

     This area is beautiful!  The grass is a bright green and well manicured.
There are several well kept flower beds, one of which is a square plot with
flowers growing into a pyramid shape.
^

libra s:aira;
lflags {  }
The House of Libra^

     Libra's home is oddly quite a mess.  The bed is laden with dirty clothing 
and dishes sit on every available square inch of counter space.
^

gemini w:aira;
lflags {  }
Gemini's Cloud^

     This cloud is so perfect, it needs no decoration, and it has none.  This
place is so beautiful you feel as though if you don't leave now, you may never 
go.
^

aquarius e:aira;
lflags {  }
Aquarius's Home^

     This room is small and modest and is sparsely furnished.  About the only
interesting thing you see here is a small poster on the wall that reads:
     A radical is a man with both feet planted firmly in the air.
     The initials F.D.R. are printed at the bottom of the poster.

The Land of Water^

     This place is lovely, however you don't like the way the ice and snow
hasn't been melted by the warm sun and air.  "BREAKING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS
ISN'T RIGHT!" you shout, but no one here seems to care.
^

cancer s:watera;
lflags {  }
The Tide Pool^

     It seems that the tide is permanently out here, since you can see no sign 
of an ocean, however this large tide pool does exist.  The water tastes of salt 
and there are hundreds of little minnows darting about through the colourful
water plants.
^

pisces n:watera;
lflags {  }
A Freshwater Pond^

     The massive ice floor of this place has a large pond dug into it.  There
are no plants or small fish in there at all, but the water tastes clean.
^

scorpio e:watera;
lflags {  }
The Dry Spot^

     This is a nice dry sandy beach.  There is no ocean or anything, just like 
a small oasis of sand in this world of water.
^

eartha e:^outside_gate w:taurus s:virgo n:southend;
lflags {  }
The Earth^

     This is a very small version of the Earth that you know, in fact, it
doesn't even resemble the Earth at all, it's just a small area of dirt and
grass with a big pine tree in the middle.
^

The Arena^

     This is a huge arena used for bull fighting.  From the looks of things
the bull fighters haven't been doing too well...there is a big scoreboard on
the north wall.  It reads:

                     Bulls: 73108
                  Matadors:   190

     Well...at least it hasn't been a total annihilation.

The Virgin's Bedroom^

     Well, you've always wanted to get in here, but there's nothing going to
happen for you, sorry.  There is a large canopy bed here with white lace
hanging from the top.  The bed looks very soft and the light glints off 
of the satin sheets.

The Goat's Pen^

     Half eaten beer cans litter the pen.  The fence has been chewed away to
the point of being totally useless, but the gate remains.

The Pentagram^

     There is a large pentagram etched into the nothingness on which you 
stand.  It's floating about three feet off the ground!
^

/* 
This pentagram is to be coded in a similar fasion to the altar on which you 
must place the chalice to get to hell.  There are 5 points to the pentagram
(examine it) Fire, Air, Water, Earth, and Spirit. the items that are to be 
put on the pentagram are:
FireBall 
WaterBall
AirBall
EarthBall
Wine
(the wine is the spirit :)
once these are all in place the player should be transported to the frontdoor 
room.

The Front Door^

     You're standing at the entrance of large mansion.  You find it odd that
there is no possible exit other than through the front door.

The Library^

     You find it kind of strange that this handsome room is the only room in
the house.  You wonder who might live here, and what the purpose of having a 
one room house in the middle of the space is.

void s:^book_case_2 d:temple@start;
lflags {  }
The Void^

     You stand in the void, which is an infinitely large room.  There is
almost nothing here.
