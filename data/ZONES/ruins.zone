Further into the Ruins^
  You have entered into the underlevels of the ruined temple. A very 
strong musky odor that makes you gasp for air for a few seconds. Looking 
around this ancient stone-walled chamber you wonder just how old it is. 
A thick layer of green, slimy moss covers most of the walls. This chamber 
has exits leading in all directions.
^

lflags { Dark }
Hall North of the Ruins^
  This is the north hall that branches off from the main ruins. The floor 
is quite damp and you move carefully along so that you don't slip. The 
hall continues to the north and the main ruins are to the south.
^
northhall2 s:northhall n:northhall3 e:northempty1;
lflags { Dark }
Northern Hall^
  You are travelling further along in the north hall. The musky air makes 
you pause for a brief second to rest and you decide to look around. The 
hall seems to continue even further to the north and there is a room to 
the east, or you can turn around and go back south. 
^
northempty1 w:northhall2;
lflags { Dark }
An Empty Room^
  This looks to be a fairly empty room. Old, rotting torn banners line the 
top of the eastern wall and what looks to be a window has been covered from
the outside by a wall of bricks. Piles of rubble from fallen rock litter 
the floor. The northern hall is to the west.

Further into the Northern Hall^
  You are travelling along in the northern hall. It is quite drafty and
the dust in the air tickles your nose. There is a small empty room to the 
west of here. The hall leads to the north and south.

Even Further into the Northern Hall^
  You are travelling along in the northern hall. Great deals of dust are 
stirred up as you walk along and you find yourself in a sneezing fit. 
After the sneezing fit ends you regain your senses and see the hallway 
continues to the north.
^

A Turn in the Northern Hall^
  You find yourself at a turn in the northern hall. You hear shrieks 
coming from the hall to the west of here and wonder what could be making 
the annoying sound. The hallway leads to the west and there is a small 
room to the east.
^
northhall6 w:northhall7 e:northhall5 n:closet2;
lflags { Dark }
Western Hallway^
  You are travelling in a western hallway. There are loud shrieks that 
are driving you mad coming from all directions. You put your hands over 
your ears to stop the sound and it does. You look around the area to see
that there is a small room to the north with an old curtain in front of 
it. The hallway leads to the east and west.

Western Hallway meets Northern Hall^
  You are travelling in a western hallway. It looks like the hallways 
from the north and west of the ruins meet here making a complete circle. 
The dust in the area is getting much thicker and it makes you cough and 
wheeze a little. You then start to see spots before your eyes and decide 
to rest for a few minutes. After your head clears you decide to press on. 
The hallway leads to the east and to the west.

An Empty Room^
  This looks to be a fairly empty room except for the piles of human 
remains that clutter the floor and the blood stains on the walls. Several
shackles line the walls and a skeleton still hangs from one. This must of 
been somesort of prison cell or torture room.

Hall East of the Ruins^
  This is the east hall that branches off of the main ruins. The walls 
are covered with thick moss and the floor is quite slippery from water
that leaks down from the upper levels. The hall leads off to the east 
and the main ruins are back to the west.

Eastern Hall^
  You are further along in the eastern hall which seems to go on a bit

and you pause for a minute to gain your senses before proceeding.

Furthur Along in the Eastern Hall^
  You have travelled quite a long way down this hall and start to wonder
where the end is or if it leads to anywhere. As you wonder more you look
around and find that some sort of garden is to the north while the hall
continues to the east.
^
gardenrm s:easthall3;
lflags { }
An Underground Garden^
  You look around and marvel at this underground garden. Looking around 
this dimly lit room you look up to find that a partially covered grate 
allows a bit of light to enter from above providing enough sunlight and 
rainwater for the plants to survive.
^
easthall4 w:easthall3 e:mossyeast;

Further in the Eastern Hall^
  You are now even further in the eastern hall. The floor is very mushy 
due to the overgrowth of moss and your feet sink into the moss with every 
step that you take.
^

lflags { Dark }
A Mossy Room^
  You are disgusted as your feet sink deep into the moss with a thick 
layer of goo underneath it. You feet slip and slide around in the goo
and you find yourself having troubles standing up. Everytime you almost 
fall over the stench of the goo forces you to regain your balance and 
steady yourself again. You can see yet another mossy room to the east of 
here.
^
sinkhole;
lflags { Dark }
A Very Mossy, Gooey Room^
  This room has even more moss on the floor, and even more goo. Your feet 
start to sink into the goo, and then they sink a little more, before you 
know it you're up to your hips and still sinking...into a lower level!
^

lflags { Dark }
An Extremely Gooey Room^
  This room is extremely gooey from the goo dripping from the ceiling. 
The thick, slimy goo covering the floor comes up to your ankles and makes 
you shudder from disgust. Your surroundings resemble that of a catacomb 
and you figure that this level was built several hundreds of centuries ago.
^

lflags { Dark }
Northern Catacombs^
  You are travelling into the northern catacombs. A fine layer of slime 
covers the floor that has seeped in from the room to the south. Your feet 
slip around a little in the slimy mess and you watch your step very 
carefully so that you do not fall.
^
gnorth2 s:gnorth w:^outsidetorch;
lflags { Dark }
End of Northern Catacombs^
  This looks to be the end of the northern catacombs. Looking around you 
wonder why this area is so small, it should be larger. You notice an old 
burned out torch hanging on the west wall with moss growing from it. 
There is also a great deal of moss growing on the ceiling and the other 
walls and there is yet more slime on the floor.
^
magelib w:mageroom e:^insidetorch;
lflags { FastMana }
Libary of the Mage^
  This is an ancient library full of shelves and shelves of many books. 
The room is lit by a magical sphere of light that is hovering in the 
middle of the ceiling, it's dancing white light grabbing your attention. 
Just being in this room seems to make you feel more magically refreshed. 
Looking to the west, you notice another lit room.

The Mage's Study Room^
  You have entered the Mage's private study room. You hope that he will 
not be upset that you have entered his dwelling or disturb his peace. You 
approach him quietly and humbly. His desk is cluttered with several ancient 
and modern scrolls and tablets of wisdom and he is thoughtfully examining 
them. You notice that his shelves are full of several spellbooks and 
magical items of all sorts. You would attempt to take something, but feel 
that it would not be right. As you move closer, the mage turns around and 
smiles at you.

layer of slime that is seeping in from the room to the north. There are a 
flight of steps that lead down into another level of the ruins.

  This is a rather dark and murky area and you feel a slight chill of 
fear run up and down your spine. Looking around the dimly lit area you 
see a few bones laying around on the floor which doesn't help your already 
nervous condition any. The catacomb has two passageways, one to the west 
and one to the south.

foul odor of rotting meat and you feel your stomach begin to turn. Looking

  You have entered into a very large catacomb. It looks to be made up of 
several large rooms that actually look quite luxurious. You figure that 
at one time, or another, someone of great importance had lived in this area.
The catacomb continues to the east and west. To the south you hear whispers 
of the past speaking of great pain and suffering. It is a very dark room, 
and you can't see anything inside of it. A sudden gust of wind brings the 
smell of decaying flesh to your nose. You don't think it would be a good

you also suspect that whoever, or whatever, was swinging a sword around is
quite powerful. The corridor leads up to the north, and seems to lead to
