The book details many arcane and powerful magics, mostly to cause
 severe pain to other beings.  In a flowing hand is written:

Fireball
        A potent piece of magic much dependant upon the power of the caster
        as to the damage it does, although sulphur enhances this.
Missile
        A similar magic, much popular amongst mages.  It is said that magical
        talismans may be created to aid this spell.
Shock
        A spell of touch, which can pass through metal armors with great ease.
        A decent caster never uses this as a party trick.
        Lodestones help with its casting.
Frost
        A spell similar to a fireball in power. A direct hit will slow
        your opponent down and make his aim less sure.  It is said that
        wintergreen will enhance this spell.

Any mage should beware that casting magic, though potent, will drain the
strength of the caster.^

lflags {outdoors cold}
Blizzard Pass^
   You are trudging through deep snow as you follow a narrow track that winds
down a long pass leading ever southward, its end is hidden by the flurries of
snow that are still falling.  On either side of you the mountains tower high
above the pass, their peaks veiled in clouds.  At one point, however, the cliff
is nowhere near as steep and a fair way up a single window has been cut,
looking out across the snows.
^
blizzard n:haven@haven e:crevasse s:pass w:gate;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Blizzard^
   You are lost in a blizzard, almost blinded by the driving snows. The howling
icy wind sends huge clouds of snow whistling across the plain totally obscuring
your view.
   The snows extend in all directions save north, where a lighted inn offers
warmth, food, and shelter from the elements.

Cliff Window^
   You are hanging onto a fairly precipitous cliff, beside a rocky window.  Far
below you can see the pass which seems to sway backwards and forwards as the
icy wind tries to tear you away from the cliff and lashes you with huge clouds
of blinding snow.
   The window is west.
^

Stonewalled Chamber^
   You are in a small stonewalled chamber.  Light streams in through a somewhat

Ruined Temple Hall^
   You are in a dark rather gloomy temple.  Huge pillars hold up the roof of
this vast chamber and cast strange shadows that seem to dance around you as you
move around.  The center of the temple is a flat platform with a now broken
altar as its centerpiece.

Pentacle Hall^
   You are in a huge pillared hall deep within the mountain.  Huge, ornately

of mystical symbols engraved on the floor.

A doorway leads east.

Shattered Hall^
   You are in a shattered hall, scorch marks and strange burns indicate a
tremendous amount of powerful sorcery was used here.  Indeed, sufficient to

as a huge fissure has opened up in the floor.

   You are in a low arched dungeon corridor.  The air is dank and musty and an

equally unpleasant and sinister.  A dark passageway leads northwards.
   There is a door to the east.
^

Messy Chamber^
   You are in a large messy chamber.  Several wooden gallows are set across
the damp ceiling and beneath them pools of blood indicate they were not merely
decorations.  A low archway leads north into an unpleasant looking corridor.

   You are in a large cavern.  Huge stalagmites have grown up almost to the

To the south you perceive a great hall, and a fetid odor comes from the west.
A small, low-walled well occupies the center of the cave.

Lava Cavern^
   You are in a huge cavern.  The walls glow and pulse with an intense red
light, reflected up from a river of lava which flows sluggishly westwards at
the south end of the cavern.  Huge explosions of lava regularly light up the
cavern to an extent that the light is almost blinding, accompanied by almost
deafening explosions.  A path leads down almost suicidally close to the lava
river.

angular runic writings, which appear totally incomprehensible to you.  A
pillared hall stretches off to the west.

Lava Path^
   You are on a narrow sloping path running uncomfortably close to the lava.
Huge explosions of lava send blasts of intense scorching heat across the path.
The path leads eastwards but the intense red glow and heat haze prevents you
from seeing where to.  A steep climb heads up.
^
lava_path2 w:lava_path;

Lava Path^
   You are at the end of an east-west path. The lava is some distance away from

heat is scarcely bearable.
^

Fissure^
   You are on a ledge in a huge fissure.  The fissure is so wide that the far
wall is hidden in darkness.  Looking down (a rather bad idea) you can see that
it is just about possible to climb the horrendous distance down to the floor of
the fissure.
^
fis_bottom s:crack;

Fissure Bottom^
   You are at the bottom of the fissure.  Precipitous rocky walls reach upwards
hanging over you as if about to crush you.  To the south, the walls vanish
beyond your light without any sign of a break.

Fire Gate^
   You are in a large rocky and very uneven cave.  A smooth path has been cut

through which the temple fire casts its flickering glow across the room.

Gate of Sorcerors^
   You are outside The Gate of Sorcerors.  Its mighty pillars tower up around
you, shielding you from the worst of the snow that is falling and from some of
the icy winds.  The ancient arched gateway between the pillars leads north into
a wide magically lit passage which disappears into the roots of the earth.
   You may enter the gate to the north, a lighted inn to the east, or trudge
south into the snows.

Crevasse^
   You are standing on the edge of a deep crevasse looking down into darkness.
Heavy snow is falling all around you partially hiding the distant mountains in
clouds of whiteness.
   The snows extend in all direction save east, where the crevasse bars the
route.  You could clamber down into the crevasse but would have great problems
in getting back out of it.

Crevasse Bottom^
   You are at the bottom of the crevasse.  Daylight, and a great deal of snow,
comes through the top of the crevasse.  A single man-made passage leads east
into a strange temple.

Elemental Temple^
   You are in the Temple Of The Elements, surrounded by decorations depicting
Earth, Air, Fire and Water.  This strange icy place gives off a feeling of
unbalance and growing evil.
There is a blinking construction sign here.

Narrow Pass^
   You are trudging along a gloomy narrow pass pelted with snow while the icy
wind feels like daggers stabbing into your unprotected flesh.  The pass
continues north and south.

The Pass^
   You are trudging along the pass.  The wind here whips around in a circular
pattern, almost veiling a narrow ravine leading eastwards.  The pass continues
north and south.

Snow Temple^
   You are in the snowy ruins of an ancient temple.  The view from here is
stunning and very picturesque but the lashing snow and icy wind are enough to
dissuade you from sightseeing.

Southern Pass^
   You are trudging down the pass.  The towering mountains, their heads cloaked
in snow, seem to leer down at you as your feet crunch into the fresh, deep and
rather cold snow.  The pass continues north and south.

The End Of The Pass^
   You are at the southern end of the pass.  The snow gives way rapidly to a
pleasant autumn sun, its gentle beams filling the whole vista with a shimmering
beautiful golden hue.  Tracks lead North, and East.

The Valley^
   You are in a green and fair valley amidst the gently murmuring oaks.  The
sun shines gently through the trees sending dancing, golden beams rippling
across the shadowy grass while midges dance between the branches.  One
particularly large oak tree rises up to the north.

The Humpbacked Bridge^
   You are standing on a crumbling humpbacked bridge looking over the side down
onto a wide but shallow stream.  The sun sparkles gently off the ripples as the
stream passes across pebbles and rocks and the fish swim between them. You hear
the faint roar of a waterfall somewhere downstream.
   You can go east or west across the bridge or follow the stream southwards.

   You are in the woods. The great trees cast green shadows across the flowers
and undergrowth as they sway peacefully in the wind.  You can walk in any
direction.

   You are in the woods listening to the trees as they rustle in the wind.
There are no visible tracks here, but you could travel through the woods in any
direction, save to the west where thick holly bushes block the route.

Shady Clearing^
   You are in a shady clearing surrounded by proud and mighty oaks.  The oaks
are surrounded by hollies and thick bushes, while creepers and weeds girdle
their ancient trunks.  There is a route from the clearing to the north and there
is a path that leads off to the east.

Grassy Clearing^
   You are in a grassy clearing beside a crystal clear, spring-fed pool that
reflects the swaying trees above.  A sandy path leads north alongside the
burbling stream.

Stream Bank^
   You stand on a quiet grassy stream bank.  The water burbles gently past you,
shaded by the thick trees and bushes which grow along the bank.  Towering oaks
cast dark rippling shadows across the almost mirrorlike rippling water which
flickers in the light.  The undergrowth blocks any way southwards along the
stream, but thins out to the north and west where paths lead off.

Hidden Pasture^
   You are standing in a small hidden field, its lush grass coated with snow.
The pasture is enclosed on all sides by steep cliffs, save for a small gap to
the west which leads into a narrow ravine.  To the north is an old crumbling
hut of some sort.

The Hermit's Hut^
   This small dank hut appears to have once been the home of a hermit or maybe
even a sorceror of some form, as the rotting junk which litters the floor
contains bits of things you have never seen before.  A narrow doorway leads
south into fresh air.
