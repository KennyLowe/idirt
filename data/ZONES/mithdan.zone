Thin Trail^
    Origionally created by animals, this trail has been widened by human
passage, although it looks as if it has not been traveled lately. The forest
has grown close to the edge of the trail, and thick branches reach overhead
that catch the snow. The thin trail continues to the east and to the south, the
snow much thinner there, and to the west there is an icy trail.
^

Mithdan2 w:Mithdan1;
lflags {outdoors nomobiles}
Dead End^
    The trail here is overrun with heavy brambles and thorns that compleatly
block your passage through. Beyond the brambles the forest continues, but
there does not seem to be any trails. The only way out is to follow the
thin trail back to the west.
^

Mithdan3 s:Mithdan8 e:Mithdan4;
lflags {Outdoors}
Heavy Woods^
    The smell of pine is overwhelming. The floor of the forest is thick with
pine needles that rustle with each step you take. The sun shines through the
trees creates shifting shadows. The forest continues to the east and south,
but is much too thick in other directions to travel.
^
Mithdan4 w:Mithdan3 e:Mithdan5 s:Mithdan9;
lflags {}
Thick Woods^
    The woods are thick and confusing. The smell of pine clogs your senses,
adding to the effect. The woods continue to the west and south. To the east
is a sandy clearing. Heavy brambles make passage to the north impossible,
which is unfortunate because there appears to be something in the distance
between the trees.
^
Mithdan5 w:Mithdan4 e:Mithdan6;
lflags {outdoors}
Sandy Clearing^
    The floor of the clearing is covered with pure white sand. The edges are
well defined, the sand not mixing with the dirt of the forest. The clearing
is filled with a sense of magic, but there is nothing noticable. In the
center of the clearing is a firepit, but the edges of the pit have no soot.
Thick brambles line the north and south of the pit, but the forest on the
east and west the forest looks thinner.
^

Mithdan6 w:Mithdan5 e:Mithdan7 n:Mithdan1 s:Mithdan10;
lflags {outdoors}
Thin Trail^
    The trail is thin and unkempt, the forest struggling to reclaim it. To
the east and west the trail thins out into forest, but to the north and south
the trail continues. The east trail is hreavily overgrown with brambles and
thorns. You can only see the sky in patches, the forest canopy has grown
thick over the trail.
^

Mithdan7 w:Mithdan6;
lflags {outdoors DEATH}
Brambles^
    The thick brambles catch at you clothes as you walk. The trail ahead is

    covered with them, but you perservere.

    Hidden by the growth, the trail unexpectedly drops away under you. You

    trip and fall into the brambles, unable to stop your rolling. The trail

    becomes steeper, and the last sight you see is an endless sea of brambles

    and thorns.
^

Mithdan8 n:Mithdan3 s:Mithdan13 e:Mithdan9;
lflags {outdoors}
Thick Forest^
    The thick forest surrounds you, overwhelming your senses. The forest
streches to the north, south, and east. The forest to the west is thick
and overgrown with brambles as far as you can see. There appears to be
trails, but after following them for a short time they fade away, leaving
you more lost then when you began.
^

Mithdan9 w:Mithdan8 n:Mithdan4 s:Mithdan14;
lflags {outdoors}
Thick Forest^
    The forest turns you around, leading you along on false trails. You wish
you had a compassm but with these woods it might not do much good. The forest
leads to the north, south, and east. As is much of the forest, the western
way is blocked by thick and heavy forests.
^

Mithdan10 n:Mithdan6 e:Mithdan11;
lflags {outdoors}
Dirt Trail^
    Although the trail still has a lingering abandoned feel, it appears to
be used occaisionally. The trail winds through the deep woods to the east
and north. The canopy of the forest reaches overhead, blocking out much of
the sunlight, but the forest still has a warm feel.
^

Mithdan11 w:Mithdan10 e:Mithdan12 s:Mithdan16;
lflags {outdoors}
Dirt Trail^
    In the distance to the east you catch the glimpse of small huts and
other buildings between the trees. A thin wisp of smoke rises overhead.
The dirt trail continues to the east and west, and to the south there is
a small clearing filled with ferns.
^

Mithdan12 w:Mithdan11 e:Mithdan67;
lflags {outdoors nomobiles}
Town Entrance^
    The town entrance is on a slight rise, giving you a good view of the
town before you. It is dotted by several temples, and has only a few
merchants. Thick woods lead away to the west, and what appears to be the
main street of the town continues to the east.
^

Mithdan13 n:Mithdan8 e:Mithdan14;
lflags {outdoors}
Thick Forest^
    All around you the forest is filled with brambles, although they look
much thinner to the north, and the eastern route has few. The forest turns
you around, confusing your senses. The musty smell of aged leaves clogs your
mind.
^

Mithdan14 w:Mithdan13 e:Mithdan15 n:Mithdan9;
lflags {outdoors}
Thick Woods^
    The woods streches off into the distance, filling the area from horizon
to horizon. You struggle not to lose your direction, but it is impossible
to tell if you are still facing the way you began. The forest is full of
sharp thorns to the south, but to the north, and west it continues
uninteruptes. To the east there is a thin path covered in snow.
^

Mithdan15 w:Mithdan14 s:Mithdan18;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Snowy Path^
    The path is drifted with snow and there is a sharp chill in the air. A
gust of wind brings more snow down on you from the mountain peak that
covers the south-eastern horizon. The path continues to the south, and
fades away into the forest to the west.
^

Mithdan16 n:Mithdan11;
lflags {outdoors nomobiles}
Sacred Clearing^
    This clearing throbs with magic, the very trees almost glow with the
force of it.  A heavy wind whips through the trees as you enter, as if the
force that guards this clearing is displeased with your presence. It would
probably be a good idea to leave and not anger it further.
^

Mithdan17 e:Mithdan18 s:Mithdan19 u:Mithdan19 d:Mithdan18;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Snowy Trail^
    The trail is covered with snow that buried the rocks, making travel very
difficult. The trail slopes upwards steeply, obviously leading up the side
of the snow covered mountain that covers the south-eastern horizon. Far above
you there appears to be some sort of structure, but from here it is
impossible to tell. The trail slopes down to the east and up to the south.
^

Mithdan18 w:Mithdan17 u:Mithdan17 n:Mithdan15;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Mountain Trail^
    The trail here slopes upwards, leading towards the top of the mountain,
although the end of the trail is obscured by the drifting snow. Forest covers
the horizon to the north, the green leaves a sharp contrast to the snowy
peaks above you. The trail continues flat towards the forest, or you can
follow it up the side of the mountain.
^

Mithdan19 d:Mithdan17 n:Mithdan17 e:Mithdan20;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Huge Rock^
    You stand atop a huge snow-covered rock. The rock itself is over thirty
paces long, and it slants upwards to the east. The snow makes it difficult
to keep from slipping on the slick surface of the stone. The path drops away
to the north, and thick green forest streches below you.
^

Mithdan20 w:Mithdan19 e:Mithdan21;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Winding Ledge^
    The ledge is covered with snow, and with each step you risk plunging into
the deep gorge below you. The stone at your back is rough and cold, and the
ledge is only a few paces wide. To the west a huge flat stone slants down
towards a path, and the ledge continues to the east.
^

Mithdan21 w:Mithdan20 e:Mithdan22;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Winding Ledge^
    The ledge here is beginning to crumble, but it is still strong enough
to cross. The wind whips in dangerous whirlwinds, funneled up towards you
by the deep gorge at your feet. The ledge continues to the east and west.
^

Mithdan22 w:Mithdan21 e:Mithdan23 s:Mithdan24;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Thin Ledge^
    The ledge here narrows out further, but thankfully the cliff at your back
is lower and you can clamber into a small snowy field to the south. The snow
is blinding, and you cannot see the bottom of the gorge or the end of the
field. The ledge continues to the west, but to the east it becomes even
narrower.
^

Mithdan23 w:Mithdan22;
lflags {Outdoors Cold DEATH}
Thin Ledge^
    The ledge narrows until you are balancing only on your heels.

    The ice is slick, and on your next step you slip.

    As you fall, you manage a desperate grab at the ledge, and by some

    miracle manage to grasp it.

    You dangle from the ledge, unable to scramble back up, for hours, shouting

    for help. No one is here to hear you.

    Finially your strength gives out, and you plunge hundreds of paces into

    the deep gorge below you.
^
Mithdan24 n:Mithdan22 s:Mithdan30;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Snowy Field^
    The whipping snow makes it impossible to see how big the field is, but
it seems to be larger then you first thought. Steep, unclimbable cliffs
strech above you to the east and west. To the north you can dimly make
out a thin ledge before a deep gorge, and the whipping snows continue to
the south.
^
Mithdan25 s:Mithdan31;
lflags {outdoors cold DEATH}
Fall^
    Blinded by the swirling snows, you stumble into an ice-covered hole.

    Before you have the chance to grab anything, you plunge to your death.

lflags {outdoors cold}
Bare Trail^
    Rising above the clouds, the trail is bare and rocky. Below you the storm
swirls snow and ice onto the mountain peak, but the air is calm here. The
bare path leads down the mountain to the south, and further up towards the
east.
^

Mithdan27 w:Mithdan26 e:Mithdan28;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Cold Trail^
    The wind is bitter cold here, the force of it almost enough to send you
staggering back down the mountain. The air is perfectly clear, and far
below you the storm clouds roil. To the east the trail widens out into a
clearing, and the trail leads back down the mountain to the west.
^

Mithdan28 w:Mithdan27 s:Mithdan34;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Stone Clearing^
    The clearing looks as if it was formed hundreds of years ago by a searing
heat. The ground beneath you is perfectly smooth stone, and its almost
polished surface reflects the suns rays into your face. The clearing becomes
a thin trail leading down the side of the mountain to the west, and to the
south the trail passes beneath a huge stone arch.

Blinding Snow^
    The snow whips in circular patterns, blinding you. You can faintly make
out the shapes of trails leading to the east and west, and to the north there
appears to be a large clearing. The clouds appear to be less then ten paces
above your head.
^

Mithdan31 w:Mithdan30 e:Mithdan32;
lflags {outdoors cold}
In the clouds^
    The clouds swirl around you, and the snow whips with stinging force into
your face. The dampness of the clouds soaks into your clothes, only to be
frozen by the cold wind. The trail dissapears into the clouds to the
east, and slops back down the mountain to the west.
^

Mithdan32 w:Mithdan31 e:Mithdan33;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Above the Clouds^
    The trail streches beneath you, lost in the sworling mass of the clouds.
A light dusting of snow is swept up by the wind, but the bulk of it remains
beneath you, exposing a bare rock path. The path continues up the side of
the mountain to the east.
^

Mithdan33 w:Mithdan32 n:Mithdan26;
lflags {outdoors cold}
Bare Path^
    The sun shines down brilliantly here, practically blinding you. Beneath
you the storm clouds roil and turn in hypnotic patterns. The stone path
winds up to the north, and slopes down into the clouds to the west.

lflags {outdoors cold}
Stone Arch^
    The stone arch streched above you, its massive columns over four paces
wide. The columns themselves are carved with incredibly intricate runes
that seem to gently throb with power. The stone path leads to a large
clearing to the north, and to the south a stone temple is carved into the
mountainside.

Temple Entrance^
    Huge stone dragons stand guard at the entrance of the temple. At first
glance they apepar to be stone, but as you try to enter the temple one
swivels its head towards you and growls menacingly. The one on your other
side stands and streches its stone wings.

Stone Corner^
    The smooth stone hall turns to the south in a perfect right angle.
Whoever built the temple had incredible precision. Through the walls to

source yet.

Temple Chamber^
    You stand just inside the temple. To the north the huge stone dragons

smooth stone corridors turn corners to the south with mathematical
precision.

    The stone tiles join each other is complex patters that strech the entire

Stone Hall^
    The patterns of the tiles draw you into them, and it takes a great
concious effort to pull your gaze away. The deep thrumming of magical
forces is even stronger now, but you still cannot find its source.
The hall turns corners to the north and south.

Elemental Chamber^
    The center of the chamber is dominated by a crystalline fountain that

magical power.
^

Mithdan41 n:Mithdan38 s:Mithdan44;
lflags {}
Tiled Hallway^
    The tiles beneath your feet appear to shift as you walk, but when you
look closer they seem perfectly normal. The walls are windowless and made
of perfectly smooth polished stone. The hallway turns a corner to both the
north and south.
^

Mithdan42 n:Mithdan39 e:Mithdan43 s:Mithdan45;

Hallway^
    The hall streches to the north where it turns a sharp corner, and to the

magical humming noise gets stronger.

Stone Hallway^
    The stone in the hall flows and drips as you walk, but is not hot. The
floor beneath you rises and falls as if it were an ocean, and the walls shift
in liquid, flowing patterns. The noise is much stronger here, and an
ethereal light spills out of the northern chamber. The hall turns a corner
to the east.

Hallway^
    The floor tiles shift in hypnotic patterns, possibly following the

Ice Hall^
    The hallway here is dripping with slowly flowing icicles and the floor is
slick with ice. No matter how much you try, you cannot focus on the walls, as
if they are actually further away then they appear. To the north the hall

each other in a flowing artwork.

Fire Hall^
    The floor and cieling are scorching hot, and the walls jet flame

artwork.

Fire and Ice^
    Amazingly, in this room fire and ice flow together, covering the walls
and creating a living, moving sculpture in the center of the chamber. You
gaze at it breifly, but when you look away it is several hours later. Time
means nothing in this room. To the north there is a smooth stone hallway,
and to the south there is a terrific wind, and you see what appears to be
a contained tornado.

    spreads its stone wings and flies ahead of you. You are trapped between

    the two of them. The last sight you see is them approaching you.

Sacred Clearing^
    The floor of the clearing is lined with pure white sand, and the
air throbs with immense stored magical energy. Time seems to pass in a
blur: Flowers sprout beneath your feet and die off again in seconds.
You feel a strange sensation on your legs and when you look down there
is a large ivy twining itself around your calfs. Paths lead off in all
directions. To the south, east, and west thin trails lead through lush
green forest, and to the north lies a huge forest of living crystal.

Crystal Trail^
    Huge crystaline trees overhang the trail and delicate crystal flowers
grow on the edge. You are afraid to touch any of them for fear that they
will shatter. Heavy wind blows through the tops of the trees, and to the
east there is an ominous groaning and cracking noise.

Crystal Trees^
    As you pass beneath the magestic crystal trees, a gust of wind blows

    through the top branches. There is a tremendous crack, and as you gaze

    up in horror a huge crystal branch crashes through the thinner boughs.

    You run as fast as possible, and throw yourself to the ground. The

    huge branch misses you, but when it strikes the ground it shatters

    into thousands of needle sharp shards. Almost is slow motion, several

    pieces fly at you, and the last thing you see is the sunlight glinting

    through them in beautiful rainbow patterns.

Dead End^
    Huge boughs from the crystalline trees have broken off and fallen to
the ground here, creating an impassable blockage of needle sharp crystal
shards. The only way out is to return to the narrow path to the east.

Crystal Path^
    A small path leads through the heart of this forest of living crystal.
A light breeze whistles through the boughs overhead, and as the branches
rub together a beautiful melody floats through the air. The path continues
to the north and south, but it appears to dead end to the west.

Crystal Border^
    Here the magical crystaline forest merges with normal forest, the green
crystal merging in a shifting kaleidascope. The crystal forest streches
away to the north, and a thin path winds through it. The path continues to
the east.

Forest Edge^
    The magical crystaline forest here merges with normal forest, the green
refracted through the crystal boughs into a shimmering rainbow of color.
The crystal forest coninues to the west and north, but the northern forest
if much too thick to try to forge through. To the south the natural green
forest continues.

Green Forest^
    Healthy green forest streches as far as the eye can see. Far to the north
you hear a faint musical song. The forest to the west is filled with brambles
and there is no way to get through. A thin trail that must have been made by
animals leads to the south, and the forest continues unabated to the north.

Forest Path^
    A thin path made by animals as they traveled daily to a water hole or
food source leads away to the west. Thick, green forest spreads away around
you. To the east a large clearing throbs with stored magical energy.

Forest^
    Heavy brambles line every direction but west, where a large clearing
throbs with immense magical energy. Far to the northwest you hear a
beautiful, but oddly random melody.

Forest Trail^
    The thin trail leads to the north and south through the thick green
oak forest. The magestic trees strech hundreds of feet above your head,
their leaves swaying gently in the wind. To the south the trees thin out
and you hear the muted crackle of pent-up magical energy.

Thick Forest^
    It is hard to tell which direction is which in this thick forest. The
only way you can tell directions is that there is a huge clearing filled
with immense magical energy to the north. The forest continues to the east,
but all other directions are blocked by brambles and thorns.

Forest^
    Thick forest continues on to the west, north, and east, but only the west
is passable. Magestic elms and oaks tower above you. To the south is a very
small clearing with some kind of hut in it.

Small Clearing^
    The grass here is trimmed short, and to the north the deep forest
streches towards the horizon. To the south is an immense wooden gate that
stand open, showing what appears to be a perfectly normal rocky path. The
gate itself crackles with heavy stored magical energy that occaisionally
discharges into the sky in huge reverse lightning bolts.

Tiny Hut^
    You stand within a tiny hut that appears to be woven of living branches
and vines, probably by an elf for temporary shelter. The roof of the hut
stands open to the weather, the magic that allowed air to pass through but
not rain having since worn off. The only exit from the hut is back to the
north.

Temple^
    This temple is dedicated to the elemental gods. Each wall is painted with
intricate and beautiful murals, each of a different elemental deity. The
north wall is painted with a figure surrounded with lightning bolts, the
west wall is painted with a figure made completly of water stands up from
the sea, and on the east wall there is a figure that is made of living
vines, rocks, and other matter standing high above a forest. The south wall
is open to the air, and leads to the main street of the town.

Street^
    The street is well maintained, and the main gates to the west are
freshly painted. To the west the gates open out onto a great forest of
oak and pine, and to the east the street continues. The wind carries a
faint scent of flowers.

Street^
    The street is slightly dusty but well maintained. The cobblestones are
neatly laid in geometric patterns. To the north is a small temple, to the
west are the main village gates and beyond them the forest. To the east is
a small garden filled with delicately carved stone statues. To the south
there is nothing but beautifully manicured gardens.

Statue Yard^
    The small garden is filled by beautifully carved statues of the elemental
gods: Naidrk the water god, Thandrain the earth god, and Klendoth the thunder
god. In between the statues are immense guardian dragon statues, their
immense size almost rivaling that of the statues. Clearly among these people
dragons are held almost at the level of the elemental gods.

Gardens^
    The gardens is well cared for, and smooth brick pathways wind among the
plants. The air is thick with the scent of flowers, and the grass is deep
and green. The path winds through the garden to the east, and to the north it
joins the main street of the town.

    Large, beautiful flowers overhang the pathway, and hundreds of honey
bees buzz around them. Stately ash trees line the edges of the brick
path. The path winds to the west and south. To the east a large fishpond
glitters in the sunlight.

Fish Pond^
    You stand on the bank of a large crystal clear fish pond. Large tropical
fish glitter iridescently in the sunlight, occaisionally leaping out of the
water to snatch a bug that has strayed too close to the surface. The
atmosphere is one of calm and serenity, and you could sit and watch the fish
for hours.

Path^
    The path here is slightly more overgrown, and creeping ivy occasionally
snakes a tendril across the bricks. The ground on either side of you is
a beautiful sea of ivy that rolls and sways with each gust of wind. The path
leads to the north, and to the south you hear the gentle burble of a
fountain.

Fountain Pool^
    The fountain draws water from an immense pool in which several large
fish swim. The fountain itself is covered with runes and is made of the
finest polished marble. The water jets over twenty paces into the sky before
cascading down several marble terraces back to the fountain pool. A path
winds through the garden to the north, and to the east is a quiet rock
garden.

Rock Garden^
    Large rocks have been placed in the center of a large strech of pure
white sand, which has been carefully raked into curving lines that swirl
around the stones like eddies in water. A wooden bench has been provided
to sit upon and contemplate the garden. The soft burble of the fountain
to the west adds a pleasant undertone.
