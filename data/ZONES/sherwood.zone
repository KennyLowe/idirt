Gateway^
        You are standing at the Gateway to adventure.  There are three paths.
Each path has a different adventure and each a different destiny.  Those
who choose to enter must be willing to face the consequences of the choices
they make.
^

lflags { }
East Fork^
        This is the road to a great adventure full of surpises, monsters, 
and lots of adventure.  This is not for the 'weak of heart' or strength.  
On each side of the road are trees that seem to reach out for you trying to
pull you into their twisted webs of branches.
^

sherwood3 s:sherwood2;
lflags { }
North Fork^
        The road stretches wide and long.  The trees on the side of the road
are ominous, but friendly enough.  The path is well worn, probably indicating
that it is not a rough one, but don't let that give you peace of mind.

West Fork^
        You are traveling on a paved road, making the journey quite easy.
The road continues west into a dense forest.  You sense danger, and prepare 
yourself for what lies ahead.  What ever that may be.

Road to Sherwood Forest^
        You have entered a very dense forest.  The trees tower over you,
blocking but only a little sunlight by which you can make out a path to
the north and to the west.
^

Trampled Path^
        You are on a heavily worn path.  It looks as if many a wagon has 
traveled through here.  The trees thin here allowing the bright sunlight to
shine down.  A tiny rabbit scurries through the bushes but he is too fast for
you.  The path continues to the north.
^

sherwood8 s:sherwood7 e:sherwood9;
lflags { Outdoors }
Worn Path^
        You have entered a small clearing of the sorts.  There is a wagon 
sitting off the path to the north.  There is some kind of contraption there.
It looks like it's brewing up some kind of magical potion or something.  Maybe 
you can talk the owner, into parting with some of his brew.

Bend in the Road^
        The path turns north here.  There is a rapidly running river to the
east but it doesn't look safe to navigate.  Maybe there is a bridge or slow
shallow point up north at which you can cross it.  Maybe not.

Path Straightens^
        The path straightens.  You look across the river and see something far
off in the distance.  It looks very interesting.  You shiver with anticipation
of the time when you will be able to explore the region across the river.

Under the Oaks^
        You are standing under oak trees.  You look up to admire their beauty.
When a passing European Swallow flys by and defacates on your face, you
frantically look around for a sink to wash your face, when you suddenly realize
that you are in sherwood forest.  I guess you will have to walk around with
bird feces on your face.
^

Turn in Path^
        The path turns west.  You definitely feel like you are getting
somewhere now.  You know it won't be long before a great adventure falls
upon you.  You shiver with anticipation.

Intersection^
        You have come to an intersection.  You must now, once again, choose
your fate.  Will you take the route to the north?  Or take the route to the
west?  Or will you chicken out and take the route to the east, back from where
your cowardly heart came from?  You must now choose.

        Oh no!  You have reached a very dark dismal part of the forest.

leading to the south

        You have chosen the right path.  This is the road to fame and fortune.

to the north.

On the Road^
        You can't help but to break out into song.  The one that comes to mind

again..."  You can't remember who sang it, but you still gotta love it.

Rainbow Waterfall^
        You are standing in a small stream just below a breath-taking 
waterfall.  The spray off the falls causes a beautiful rainbow to stretch 
across the river.  You can not imagine a more beautiful place.  Jagged rocks 
cover the bed of the stream just below the falls.  The stones become smoother 
and polished further down stream from the continuous wearing of the water.  
The grass is short, soft, and green, perfect for a picnic with your 
sweatheart.

some reason.

        You continue to travel along the beaten path.  The brush grows thick

forest.

Corner^
        You have reached yet another turn in the road.  The trees grow dense
to the west.  They are ominous and block all sunlight from reaching the ground.
You stand here trying to muster up the courage to venture on.  You look toward
the trees and a shiver runs up your spine.  You know that if you continue.
There is no coming back.  It is all or nothing.  What are you a man or mouse?
