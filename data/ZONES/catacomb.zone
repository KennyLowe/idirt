        One day, Cedric and Ged found themselves standing at the
        entrance to the Catacombs.
        Said Ced, "How are we ever to traverse this maze of catacombs?"
        Said Ged, "I do not know, for the interconnections of its
                   chambers are most intricate.  Perhaps we should ask
                   Tedd, the Zen Master of Aber."
        So they did.
        Said Ged, "Oh wise and most learned Tedd, how can one find one's
                   way through the treacherous maze of the catacombs?"
        Said Tedd, "One can't.  Send Ned."
        And suddenly Cedric and Ged were most pleased, for Tedd had
        shown them the path to enlightenment.

The Crypt^
   You are in a small room, standing before the entrance to a vast and ancient
crypt.  Low moaning sounds echo from within the catacombs before you, sending
chills up your spine.
   An archway, its keystone carved in the shape of a human skull, leads south
into darkness, while cool air blows in from the relative safety of the church
above.

The Catacombs^
   You are standing in a small, subterranean chamber.  Set into the walls at
regular intervals are deep recesses, within which lie the stone tombs of a
generation long since departed.  A gentle breeze blows in from the passage to
the north, while dark hallways lead south, east, and west.
   A spiral staircase fills one corner of the room.
