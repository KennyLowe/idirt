Citadel  e:Paths s:^gates;
lflags{NoMobiles Outdoors}
Citadel Entrance^
   You are standing at the entrance to a huge citadel, carved from the very
rock of the mountains.  A pair of gates are set into the southern edge of the
deep rocky bowl you stand in.  A single exit leads east down a narrow path into
the valley below.
^
Paths s:Gully1 w:Citadel d:Gully1;
lflags{Outdoors} 
Rocky Paths Winding Down^
   You are following a rocky path winding down southward into a narrow, steep-
sided valley, the only other exit is west towards a huge citadel set on the
mountain top.
^
Gully1 n:Paths e:Gully2 u:Paths d:Gully2;
lflags{Outdoors}
Narrow Gully^
   The path turns sharply from the north here, plunging steeply down into a
narrow gully, a mere six feet wide.
^
Gully2 e:Northend w:Gully1 u:Gully1 d:Northend;
lflags{Outdoors}
Narrow Gully^
   You are clambering through a narrow rocky gully, the floor of which is
sloping at an angle of almost 45 degrees.  Shale and loose stone make the gully
treacherous, as your feet send bits of rock tumbling down into the valley
below.
   You can clamber up the gully towards a turning or down towards the valley
floor.
^
Northend s:Northernend w:Gully2 u:Gully2;
lflags{Outdoors}
North End Of Valley^
   You are at the northern end of a steep mountainous valley.  The valley
extends away southward as far as you can see, flanked on each side by the
mighty mountain peaks towering into the clouds.
   A narrow gully leads west up the side of a cliff, climbing at a dangerous
looking angle towards the top.
^
Northernend n:Northend e:Oak s:Stream2 w:NWcorner;
lflags{Outdoors}
Northern End Of Valley^
   You are near the northern end of the valley.  The dark mountains close up
around you to the north, although a narrow track for some reason leads north
right towards the very end of the valley.  Elsewhere around you the view is
obscured by trees, although from the south you can hear the musical tinkle of
water.
^
Oak n:Tops e:FSedge s:Bridge w:Northernend;
lflags{Outdoors}
Oak Forest^
   You are walking through well spaced oak trees, whose low tangled branches
reach out around you, confusing the light and rustling quietly in the wind.
   The forest extends in all direction save from the north, where it stops
abruptly, cut short by a massive towering cliff.  To the west there seems to be
a clearing.
   A path climbs up the cliff side to the north.
^
FSedge n:Path e:Tforest s:Sedge w:Oak;
lflags{Outdoors}
Forests Edge^
   You stand on the edge of the forest, which extends south east and west as
far as you can see. To the north the trees give way to a grassy hill.  A narrow
worn path leads north up the hill.
   To the south the path through the forest is almost blocked by thick hedges,
but a few gaps enable you to squeeze through.
^
NWcorner e:Northernend s:Stream1 w:Passage@EForest;
lflags{Outdoors}
North-Western Corner Of Valley^
   You are standing in amongst some trees in the North-Western corner of the
valley.  Soaring cliffs bar any route either north or west, but the valley
extends to the south and east.^w  A passage leads through the mountain to the
West.^w
^

Spring e:Stream1 w:Ledge;
lflags{Outdoors}
Spring^
   You are standing in a small rocky hollow on the edge of the western
mountains.  A single spring trickles from the rock here, running eastwards out
into the valley proper.  Apart from east back into the valley, steep rocky
cliffs bar all exits, save west along a narrow ledge.
^
Stream1 n:NWcorner e:Stream2 s:Stream3 w:Spring;
lflags{Outdoors}
Stream^
   You are standing beside a small silvery stream which gurgles gently from a
rocky hollow to the west, to run gently eastwards between the trees which
surround you.
   Tracks lead through the trees in all directions.
^
Stream2 n:Northernend e:Bridge w:Stream1;
lflags{Outdoors}
Stream^
   You are standing beside a narrow stream, which tinkles eastwards through the
trees.  You can travel through the trees in any direction save south where the
stream has cut a deep channel too wide to ford.
^
Bridge n:Oak e:Sedge s:Send w:Stream2;
lflags{Outdoors}
Humpbacked Bridge^
   You are standing at the northern end of a small humpbacked bridge, a
picturesque stone structure coated in moss and creepers, which crosses the
stream to the south of you.  Paths seem to converge here from the north, west
and east.
^
Sedge n:FSedge e:Tforest w:Bridge;
lflags{Outdoors}
Stream Edge^
   You are on the edge of the stream, hemmed close to the water by thick
bushes, and clumps of reeds. One or two gaps in the hedges allow you to squeeze
northwards back into the main part of the forest.  Other paths allow you to
walk east or west along the stream bank.
^
Tforest n:FSedge e:Tforest s:Eside w:Sedge;
lflags{Outdoors}
Thick Forest^
   You are lost amidst a thick mass of trees and bushes which block direct
paths forcing you to take long and probably circular routes in your attempts to
get past them.
^
Edge e:Stream3;
lflags{Outdoors}
Forest Edge^
   You are standing in amongst some trees.  The forest continues only to the
east, as all other routes are blocked by tall sheer cliffs.
^
Stream3 n:Stream1 e:Beside s:Rclearing w:Edge;
lflags{Outdoors}
Stream^
   You are standing on the south bank of a small gently flowing stream,
surrounded by dense forest.  Gaps through the trees allow you to travel in any
direction with a small amount of effort and squeezing through bushes.
   The water is so shallow here you can easily wade across.
^
Beside e:Send s:Tforest2 w:Stream3;
lflags{Outdoors}
Beside The Stream^
   You are on the south bank of the stream. Thick forest lies in all directions
save north where the stream gurgles its way eastwards, following a deep
channel, too wide to cross.
   Through the trees to the east you can make out a small bridge.
^
Send n:Bridge e:Bank s:Ftrack w:Beside;
lflags{Outdoors}
South End Of Bridge^
   You are standing at the south end of a small picturesque humpbacked bridge.
The bridge crosses a stream to the north, while paths run south into the
forest, and east and west along the banks of the stream.
^
Bank s:Pool w:Send;
lflags{Outdoors}
Stream Bank^
   You are standing on the bank of the stream, which swings round from north
to east.  Tracks lead south and west through the trees.
^
Eside n:Tforest e:Rbank s:Fedge3 u:^ladder2elf;
lflags{NoMobiles Outdoors}
Eastern Side Of Valley^
   You are standing amidst some trees on the eastern edge of the valley.  The
forest continues to the north south and west, although a deep stream bars any
exit west.  To the east the trees thin out rapidly, giving way to a steep bare
rocky rise.
^
Rclearing n:Stream3 e:Tforest2 w:Crest@EForest;
lflags{Outdoors}
Rocky Clearing^
   You are standing in a rocky clearing, strewn with the debris of the many
landslides, which have cascaded down the cliffs to the south and west.  To the
east and north paths plunge back in amongst the trees that fill most of the
valley.^w  A precarious path leads over the mountain to the West.^w
^
Tforest2 n:Beside e:Ftrack s:Wedge w:Rclearing;
lflags{Outdoors}
Thick Forest^
   You are lost in thick forest, tangles of bushes and the shadowy tree trunks
prevent you from seeing far in any direction.  Even the surrounding mountains
don't help, as they are in all directions.
^
Ftrack n:Send e:Pool s:Evalley w:Tforest2 u:Temple@Start;
lflags{Outdoors}
Forest Track^
   You are following a track which leads north through the forest towards a
humpbacked bridge.  The track seems to form here from a myriad of tiny trails
which lead in all directions through the trees.
   A wide paved path winds up a huge mound set amongst the trees.  On the top
of the mound you can make out a temple of some sort.
^
Pool n:Bank e:Fedge3 s:Tforest4 w:Ftrack;
lflags{Outdoors}
Pool^
   You are standing beside a small, smooth pool, fed from a stream which runs
in from the north.  The cool shallow waters of the pool flicker and dance with
the breeze, reflecting the swaying trees, and the tiny dark specks of the
thousands of insects which dart back and forth around you.
   Paths lead through the forest in all directions from here.
^
Fedge3 n:Eside e:Rbank s:Fedge5 w:Pool;
lflags{Outdoors}
Forests Edge^
   You are standing on the eastern edge of the forest, which gives way to a
steep rocky bank.  The trees continue north, south, and west.
^
Rbank n:Eside s:Fedge5 w:Fedge3 d:Fedge3;
lflags{Outdoors}
Rocky Bank^
   You are standing on a steep rocky bank which leads down to the south, north
and west.  The bank becomes too steep to climb up any further east.  From here,
you can look west across the forest, and north towards the grey marshes.
^
WEdge n:Tforest2 e:Evalley s:Evalley;
lflags{Outdoors}
Western Edge Of Valley^
   The forest stops here, against the sheer rocky walls that form the western
edge of the valley.  Elsewhere the forest continues, although it doesn't appear
to go much further south before the reaching the southern end of the valley.
^
Tforest4 n:Pool e:Fedge5 s:Evalley w:Evalley;
lflags{Outdoors}
Thick Forest^
   You are lost in thick forest, tangles of bushes and the shadowy tree trunks
prevent you from seeing far in any direction.  Even the surrounding mountains
don't help, as they are in all directions.
^
Fedge5 n:Fedge3 e:Rbank s:Npath w:Tforest4 u:Npath;
lflags{Outdoors}
Forests Edge^
   You are standing amidst a few trees on the edge of the forest, hedged in by
a sheer rock wall to the south, and a steep, but climbable, bank to the east.
Elsewhere the forest thickens up and continues.
   A narrow path climbs along a twisty ledge along the cliff to the south.
^
Evalley n:Ftrack e:Tforest4 s:Gap w:Wedge;
lflags{Outdoors}
End Of Valley^
   You are at the southern end of the valley.  The trees continue north, east
and west from here, but to the south everything ends in a huge black cliff,
which soars high up above you at close to vertical for several hundred feet.
On its top your eyes seem to catch the flicker of something glittering.
   A narrow rocky crack leads south down the narrowing gap between the cliffs.
^
Path n:C_Yard@Church s:FSedge d:FSedge;
lflags{Outdoors}
Path^
   You stand on a path which leads down into the valley and northwards into a
churchyard of some sort, with a ruined church standing beside it. The path also
leads back down into the valley.
^
Hut e:Ledge;
lflags{}
Hidden Hut^
   You are inside a low wooden hut, carefully concealed by greenery and rocks
to provide a quiet, restful shelter.  The only exit is a door to the east.  To
judge from the bed in the corner, the occupant of the hut was here recently.
^
Ledge e:Spring w:Hut;
lflags{Outdoors}
Ledge^
   You are standing on a narrow ledge overlooking the crystal pool where the
spring issues from the mountain.  The ledge leads east back to the spring or
west towards a small hut, carefully concealed from view.
^
Gap n:Evalley s:Deep;
lflags{Outdoors}
End Of Gap^
   You are in a narrow rocky gap, which closes up to the south, ending in a
wide arched tunnel, with a carved entrance.  The tunnel plunges south into the
mountain depths.  To the north the gap widens up leading back out into the
forest.
^
Npath n:Fedge5 s:Piper@Cave u:Leap@Castle d:Fedge5;
lflags{Outdoors}
Narrow Path^
   You are following a narrow difficult path, which twists its way along a
crack in the cliff rising up to the south.  A set of steps lead up towards the
cliff top climb past a narrow, slanted cave-mouth which leads south into
darkness.
^
Deep n:Gap s:Dark;
lflags{}
Deep Tunnel^
   You are following a deep, seemingly magically lit tunnel, which plunges
beneath the mountain.  The tunnel continues north and south.
^
Dark n:Deep s:Gate@Blizzard;
lflags{}
Dark Tunnel^
   You are following a dim magically lit tunnel which burrows deep underground.
The walls glow gently showing off the myriad sparkling colors of the tunnel
walls, which were quite evidently dug, and are certainly not natural.
^
Mpath e:Woods@Blizzard w:Falls;
lflags{Outdoors}
The Mountain Path^
   You are walking along a narrow mountain path that winds west and upwards
into the nearby mountains.  Rocks and trees obscure your view of the valley
below.  The path runs east and west along a small ridge.  To the west you hear
a sustained sound that reminds you of thunder.
^
Falls e:Mpath d:pool@frobozz;
lflags{Outdoors}
The Hidden Falls^
   You stand in an alcove carved by wind and water into the side of a mountain.
High above the ground, water rushes over a ledge.  In a spectacular array of
colors and sounds, the airborn water falls to the rocks below.  A path leads
east along the ridge rocks.  There is a small pool of water among the rocks
below you.  It appears you can climb down to the pool if you're unencumbered.
There is a blinking construction sign here.
^
Moorpath n:Misty1@Moor s:Steps d:Steps;
lflags{Outdoors}
Path^
   You are following a narrow winding path off the moors, leading south towards
some steps.  The view southward from here is breathtaking, as the steps are at
the edge of a steep drop, giving you a superb vantage upon the wild misty
mountains.  The peaks soar high around you, walling in a wide valley.  The lush
green of the valley deep below, and the glittering of water contrast superbly
with the snowy cloud veiled mountain tops, a stunning picture that you could
contemplate for hours...
^
Steps u:Moorpath d:Steps2;
lflags{Outdoors}
The Cliff Steps^
   You are standing on a set of narrow winding steps carved into the side of a
steep cliff face.  The steps descend down as far as you can see, and
contemplating them for a long time leaves you feeling giddy.  The steps lead
upwards to the lip of the cliff.  To the east, but well beyond your jumping
ability you can see a wide ledge and what appears to be a cave mouth.
^
Steps2 u:Steps d:Tops;
lflags{Outdoors}
The Cliff Steps^
   You are standing on a set of narrow winding steps carved into the side of a

the ground, and the treetops.
^
Tops s:Oak u:Steps2 d:Oak n:talon1@talon;
lflags{Outdoors}
Tree Tops^
   You are almost at the bottom of the cliff path, which leads south into thick
forest and north into a cave. The steps wind up and up the cliff dwindling 
to a mere speck.
