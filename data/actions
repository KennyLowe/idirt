# message-list
#
# s = single, takes a target as argument.
# a = all, may be directed to all in a room, no target as argument.
# h = hostile.
# i = wizards may ignore this action if performed by mortals.
# o = object, may take an object as argument (use %o in messages).
# t = text, may take a text as argument (use %s in messages).
# f = far, target do not have to be in the same room as actor.
#
# message-list is a list of messages of the following form.
# type:message
# type is one of: all, me, target, sender, others.
# if type is a, then all and me must both be present.
# if type is s then target and sender must both be present.
# either type a or s should be specified, a is assumed if neither is
# present.
#
# In the messages the following codes are defined:
#
# %~ refer to him/her depending on gender of actor in all messages except
# 'sender' where it refer to gender of target.
# %^ refer to his/her but otherwise like %~.
# %a is name of actor.
# %t is name of target.
# %o is name of object if o is present.
# %s is the message text if t is present.
# %[...x...%/...y...%]  select string x if ACTOR is male, otherwise string y.
#
# For the last two, both str1 and str2 may contain % codes, example:
# string str1%<str2%/str3%<str4%/str5%>str6%>str7
# if target is male, the result will be str1str2str7
# if target is female, the result will be str1str3str5str6str7
# str4 will never show, since it is the male text inside a portion that is
# only handled when the target is female.
#
# if command has 's' option defined and others is missing, no message
# will be sent and the only people who recieve notice is the performer
# and target of the action.
