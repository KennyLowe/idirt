[X]STORE [player-name]
[X]If not followed by any argument, it means yourself.
[X]This command creates a zone for you, its name will be your characters name.
[X]It is not intended for making zones for mortals to adventure in,
[X]but it lets you build your own personal stuff with much more fun and ease
[X]then the traditional way of bugging your God do it for you.
[X]The STORE command does the following:
[X]
[X]- Marks all mobiles/locations/objects you have created (with CLONE) as non-
[X]  temporary, so that they will be reset on a reset instead of destructed.
[X]
[X]- Sets their reset-values to the exact state the mobiles/locations/objects
[X]  are in when the STORE command is issued. Your zone will be reset on every
[X]  reset to the exact state it was in, the last time you did a STORE.
[X]
[X]- Saves everything on disk, so that you may LOAD your zone at a later time.
[X]  Your zone will remain in the the game even after you quit,
[X]  but will go away if you don't come back within a certain period of time,
[X]  (currently 3 days). It will in any case be loaded again automatically the

TELL [player] [msg]    or    [player] [msg]
Allows you to tell a player something.  Although you really ought only
to be able to tell something to someone in the same room, we found the
game as a whole works better with TELL  as it is.  Similary, you could
argue that WHO is unrealistic,  but the results   of its  absence  are
simply many "Who's playing?" shouts.

Example: "george How are you doing?"             See also MOBILE

[!X PTitleEdit]displayed.
[X PTitleEdit]Player title:
[X PTitleEdit]You are not required to enter a %s in your title being a Wizard.
[X PTitleEdit]You can change anybodys title if their level is below yours.
[X PTitleEdit]
[X PTitleEdit](In this context, a 'level' is Mortal - Wiz - ArchWiz etc...)
[PTitleEdit]
[PTitleEdit PClone]Mobile title:
A mobile's title is the text that describes it when you type
'look' or enter its room. The '%s' has no meaning here. You
can only change title on in-game created mobiles and only on
your own, or those who belong to someone with a level lower
then yours. (See above for the meaning of 'level' here.)
