Hours File Configuration

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The file 'data/hours' controls the opening and closing hours of your MUD if
you chose to run your MUD during specific hours. If you don't wish to do so
then you have no need to read this file, or have the 'data/hours' file present.

The hours file contains a listing of times that tells the MUD when it should
allow users. If this file is either empty or does not exist at all the MUD
will completely ignore it and the MUD will always be open to users.

The usage for the hours file is fairly simple:

	DayName HH:MM -> DayName HH:MM
	(Note that HH:MM is in 24-hour style time. 4:00pm = 16:00)

An example (Friday 5:00pm -> Monday 5:00am):

	Friday 17:00 -> Monday 5:00

The above example means that the MUD is open to users between Friday 5:00pm
and Monday 5:00am. You may also specify multiple lines in the hours file.

	Monday 18:00 -> Tuesday 5:00
	Tuesday 18:00 -> Wednesday 5:00
	Wednesday 18:00 -> Thursday 5:00
	Thursday 18:00 -> Friday 5:00
	Friday 18:00 -> Monday 5:00

You may also abbreviate the names of days according to the following table:

	Sunday		Sun		Monday		Mon
	Tuesday		Tue		Wednesday	Wed
	Thursday	Thu		Friday		Fri
	Saturday	Sat

Note that players will be notified 15 and 5 minutes before the game is to
shutdown.
