NOTICE! This code may be unstable! Use at your OWN risk.

The files that are used by the MUD for the world may be compressed using
the compress or gzip utilities. If you wish to do this you must first edit
the configuration file (include/config.h) and make sure that USE_ZOPEN is
defined.

You must then run gzip (or compress) on the files that you wish to be 
compressed. The following files may be compressed:

	data/actions
	data/hours
	data/levels
	data/locations
	data/mobiles
	data/objects
	data/pflags
	data/verbs
	data/zones

If you do compress any of the preceding files, be sure to edit the 
bootstrap file and change the filename that each part of the bootstrap
is looking for. For instance, if you gzip the 'locations' file, you need
to replace:

	L:locations		-with-		L:locations.gz

As this code is found to be completely stable it will be spread to other
files, such as zones, help files, info files, policy files, and more.
