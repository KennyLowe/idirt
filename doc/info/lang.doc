iDiRT Language System
1995, 1996 by Illusion (shill@nyx.net, aberadm@phreebyrd.com)
	      Concept by Moses (moses@phreebyrd.com)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The iDiRT language system may not be ported to another MUD software without
the permission of Illusion and Moses. Contact them for permission before you
decide to start porting the language system to your MUD.

To add a new language to the iDiRT Language System you must first have a new
quest installed. The language system is based on the quest system completely.
After you have added the quest to the MUD, edit the nflags.h and nflagnames.h
files like you edited the quests.h and questnames.h files.

Remember that the maximum number of languages allowed is currently 32, just
like the maximum number of quests.

If you have any further questions, please address them to Illusion.
