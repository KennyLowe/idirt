* Installed iDiRT Mailer
 
[January 4, 1995]

* NewStyle added

* Fixed up the exit handler

* Fixed emote bug

* NoWish (for Wizards, and Wizards can give it to users to keep them quiet)

* Advisor and Upper Wizard line added

* NoAWiz, NoAdvisor, NoGod, and NoUpper commands added (like NoWiz)

* NoSlain written (Wizards don't see slain messages)

* Idle command written (Demi+'s can act idle)

* Punt command written

* WLoad command written (shows system load)

* System command added, Raw has been changed to show name

* Users will now see their idle time if the first command entered is 
  'ustat', 'users', or 'hosts'

* Added a command to display time in a HH:MM:SS format at all times
  (sec_to_ddhhmmss) (note: will display days as well -- DD:HH:MM:SS)

[January 6, 1995]

* Added sflagscom and eflagscom

[January 12, 1995]

* Wrote 64-bit lflags. This was pretty fun because I tried this once 
  before but failed miserably. This time I figured out how pflags 
  worked first before trying it again, and this time it worked.

* Prompt codes written:
    %h : Health
    %c : Score
    %l : Level (Number)
    %n : Name

[January 13, 1995 (Friday)]

* Wrote a function called make_rank() that produces new output in the 
  score command. make_rank() displays to the user their name and level 
  instead of their title.

* Finally made the new setins part of the game (they were just configurable 
  before)

* Now if a person is in a fight and if they have the '%h' code in their 
  prompt to display health, their health will not be told to them when they 
  are hit during a fight.

[January 14, 1995]

* Players now see the host they last logged in from.

* Using a magic point based system for using spells.

* Wrote a chat line with 100000 channels.

* Wrote forget code.

* Now stores the number of mobiles a player has killed and the number of 
  time that the player has died. Now the players can get a ratio of number 
  of mobiles they have killed and the number of times they have died.

* Wrote an autosaver.

* Wrote a new function to handle messages to users based on their level 
  and a persons visibility level.

[January 15, 1995]

* Changed the cosmetics on wizlist.

* Changed the cosmetics on usercom(), ustats(), and hostcom().

* Changed loseme() (in mobile.c) to tell Wizards if a player has lost link.

[January 18, 1995]

* Started to work on a Link Loss saver for players

[January 19, 1995]

* Finished the Link Loss saver for players. First off, this is nothing 
  like the one that Northern Lights uses, I do not even bother with keeping 
  sockets open and all that good stuff. I just store the players last 
  location to the user file and place all their items in a new room that I 
  have created with a user id placed on the item. For full details, look 
  at the code.

[January 20, 1995]

* Wrote 64-bit sflags.

* Wrote away, silent entry, noinventory, nofight, noslain, gossip line, 
  anon line, saveall, shall macro (healall, saveall).

* Wrote healfight and autoheal sflags. Players are no longer allowed to 
  be healed during a fight unless they have the HealFight sflag (or the 
  person healing is an Avatar or above). The AutoHeal sflag will heal 
  players right after a fight.

[January 21, 1995]

* Fixed actions so that text can be passed.

* Wrote lit, wizards can light themselves so players can see.

* Wrote Chat, a talk utility that lets people select a channel (Channel) 
  and talk on it. This allows multiple users to talk on the same line, 
  like they were all in the same room.

* Wrote a socket handler (file descriptors)

[January 25, 1995]

* Wrote wizecho

[January 26, 1995]

* Changed the cosmetics of the bootstrap loader

[January 27, 1995]

* Wrote socket messages for people with the Socket eflag.

* Changed stat [showplayer()] to show eflags if the person using stat has 
  the eflagedit pflag and the number of times died and number of mobiles 
  killed.

* Score [scorecom()] now shows the number of times player has died, and 
  how many mobiles they have killed.

* Wrote locationscom() to use the locations command instead of locations 
  calling zonescom().

[January 28, 1995 - February 24, 1995]

* Worked more on socket messages.

* Added in reboot code (by Kender, fixed by Illusion)

* Added in acct (by Thrace)

* Wrote an Oracle interface

* Changed ustats

* Upgraded socketcom() 

* Upgraded puntcom()

* Added in more messages for Wizards.

                               ** VERSION 1.10 **

[March 1, 1995]

* Wrote mstat (mortal stats)

* Changed acct to accept a zone name as a parameter, added in more 
  functionality to the acct command as well.

* Made objectscom() to replace dircom() (objects command)

[March 2, 1995]

* FINGER command written, it lets players check to see when another player 
  was last on if the player finger'd has the FINGER sflag turned on.

* QDONE command written, shows what quests have been done since the last
  reset.

[March 5, 1995]

* NOSAVECUT command written, it allows users to choose to save connection 
  if they have cut their connection.

[March 17, 1995]

* Sithel let me have his FIND command that searched for locations from a 
  partial string. I enhanced the command completely to check for players, 
  mobiles, objects, and location names and changed the output completely 
  as well.

[March 27, 1995]

* Changed the reboot command considerably and started to Alpha test a 
  crash->reboot handler.

* Wrote a LOSTLOC command for Gods+ to clear out the lost location 
  variable for users.

                             ** VERSION 1.10.01 **

[March 29, 1995]

* Wrote the CLEAR command to clear the screen.

* Changed the bulletin command completely to allow each different power 
  level (including mortal) to be able to view their own page.

[April 1, 1995]

* Finished the VIEWCOM command to allow a person to view the input 
  handlers of players on the MUD.

* Wrote the SEEEXT command to toggle the SEEEXTENDED sflag. This allows a 
  Wizard+ to turn on/off extended messages from the MUD. These messages are 
  basically who is echo/echoall/etc'ing, punt'ing, and other miscellaneous 
  messages.

[April 2, 1995]

* Fixed the follow command.

* Wrote the TEXTRAW command. This is a RAW utility that allows a Avatar+ 
  to place text inside of the brackets and display a message (like the 
  SYSTEM and RAW command).

* Wrote SEEIDLE command so that Uppers could see the real idle times of 
  players with the IDLE flag on.

* Wrote BEEP command so that players can beep each other.

* Wrote NOBEEP for Uppers so that they can disable all beeps from the MUD.

[April 3, 1995]

* Wrote the CONVERSE command so players can save time while saying things 
  to each other.

[April 5, 1995]

* Wrote the FOLLIST command so that Wizards+ can see who is following who.

[April 8, 1995]

* Wrote a PZAP command (idea from Moses). This command is just like the 
  ZAP command except it does not delete the player that you PZAP.

                             ** VERSION 1.20.01 **

[April 23, 1995]

* Added a new color code that makes text blink.

* Wrote a prompt for Wizards that will let them choose their invisibility
  level before they enter the game.

* Wrote 'WHON' which is just like the who command except it displays the
  player name instead of level.

* Once again changed the outputs of the usercom() and ustats().

[April 24, 1995]

* Added in more messages, and changed the colors for some messages.

* Cleaned up s_socket.c and fixed a compiler warning on the #define for
  NULL.

* Fixed a bug in the prompt with the change that converse mode makes
  to the prompt.

* VIEWCOM now displays idle times.

[April 25, 1995]

* Wrote a pager for info files and will soon be expanding it to help 
  files and various other parts of the MUD.

* Wrote a PAGER command for users so that they can adjust the pager
  to the number of lines that they desire or 0 lines to turn it off.

[April 28, 1995]

* Improved the debug() function in the exit handler to output the
  time into a correct string. The old code I wrote was very messy
  and at times created strange output.

* Many improvements to the mailer, see /src/mail.c for a listing.

* Made changes to mstatcom().

* Added more color to usercom() and ustats().

[May 2, 1995]

* Improved the USERS and WHO commands available during the login
  process.

* Made change accept a parameter of MAGIC to change magic points.

* Players can now be logged if the site owner places their name
  in the 'data/logged' file. The logs are created in the 'data/LOGS/'
  directory. The filename will be the players name. Only certain 
  commands are logged and the login and logout times.

[May 3, 1995]

* Improved the AWAY command.

* Made the BUSY flag available for player to toggle.

                             ** VERSION 1.30.00 **

[May 20, 1995]

* Made all header files #if'd.

* Changed USERCOM yet again.

* Removed the Lost Location code for the time being.

* Moved all header files (except 'config.h', 'kernel.h', 
  'VERSION.H', 'MACHINE.H' and 'OS.H') to the 'include/' 
  directory.

* Changed the SHUTDOWN and CRASH procedures.

[May 23, 1995]

* Started to work on manual pages for the iDiRT system.

                             ** VERSION 1.50.00 **

(Note: Version 1.50.00 is a rewrite of the 1.30.00 code, and only new changes
       to the code have been logged here.)

[June 1, 1995]

* Rewrite of the iDiRT code has begun.

[June 12, 1995]

* Indent'd all of the iDiRT code.

[July 10, 1995]

* Wrote the BURN command.

[July 20, 1995]

* The FIND command has been changed. It now gives the number ID for the
  player/mobile/object/location found.

* Wrote a function to check rooms to see if players can enter them based
  from the player level lflags.

* Wrote the FAKEQUIT command that will also let players use socket 
  messages for the basis of their exit from the game.

[July 21, 1995]

* Wrote the OPTIONS command to let users check their options.

* Wrote NOWET so that players don't have to see weather.

[July 22, 1995]

* Fixed a bug in lflags that was causing temperature and light
  lflags to mess up. Also rewrote all lflag defines.

* Installed the wimpy code (not sure if it works yet though).

* Wrote the KLOCK command so that players can lock their keyboard
  and walk away.

                             ** VERSION 1.60.00 **

[August 1, 1995]

* A file called 'hosts' can now be created in the data directory
  to alias hostnames. An example file is provided.

[August 2, 1995]

* Added the UPDATE system from Hykin and fixed a few major bugs in it.

                               ** VERSION 1.65 **

[August 4, 1995]

* Wrote the CFR (Call for Reset) command.

[August 8, 1995]

* Added in IDENT support. The Ident support that iDiRT uses is through
  libident (version 0.17a), you will most likely need this library to 
  get IDENT to work correctly. You'll also have to uncomment the line
  in Makefile that links in the Ident library and in config.h, you'll
  have to go to the #define USE_IDENT and uncomment it.

[August 10, 1995]

* Wrote the PLOC command to let Gods put a user in a room without the
  user knowing it.

* Wrote the POLICY command to view policies instead of having to use
  INFO.

[August 11, 1995]

* Fixed objects so that if they are invis, they are really invis.

* Changed the socket message system for Ident support.

* Fixed little bugs in showplayer()

* Changed finger a bit.

[August 14, 1995]

* Fixed crash bugs that were in socketcom()

[August 15, 1995]

* Changed tiptoe so that Gods will see when a player has used it.

* Fixed punt so that people could be punted into death rooms.

* Burn now removes pflags and mask.

* Wrote a is_conn variable for players to help out with socketcom()
  and viewcom(). This variable shows that a socket is being used
  for a connection.

* Wrote the SIC command that lets wizards sic mobiles on players.

[August 16, 1995]

* Updated PFILTER for the extra levels and for Eflag checking. The
  following may be filtered in the help file:

	U : Master User
	G : God
	D : Avatar (Demi-God)
	V : Advisor
	A : ArchWizard
	R : Prophet
	W : Full Wizard (Non Emeriti)
	X : Apprentice - Emeriti

	L : Level Checking
	P : PFlag Checking
	M : Mask Checking
	E : EFlag Checking
	! : Negative Return

* Placed all the new commands into the help file.

* Wrote ATVIS, that lets Wizards do a command at a vis level.

* Made MACHINE.H and OS.H able to autodetect your machine and OS type.

[August 23, 1995]

* getuaf() now returns an error if a NULL value is passed to it.

* Clone mobile seems to work fine now that getuaf() has been fixed.

* Changed the output of clone mobile and clone object.

* Fixed the enter vis code so that the motd doesn't display twice.

[August 28, 1995]

* Wrote a function to handle special codes for the MUD. So far it
  only displays the version number and has a clear screen code, but
  it will be expanded in the near future.

[August 29, 1995]

* Wrote NOORACLE. This takes you off of the user list that Oracle can see
  and does not allow Oracle to send you tell messages.

[August 30, 1995]

* Fixed a crash bug in the special code handler.

* Updated the HELP file some more.

* Replaced all of the help screens.
  (From Moses)

                               ** VERSION 1.67 **

[August 31, 1995]

* Changed the PFLAG structure to handle up to 96 flags.

[September 5, 1995]

* Fixed major bugs in the socketcom() function.

* Updated the new_player() function to set the player's level
  to 1 in case they choose to use the who/users command at the
  login prompt.

[September 7, 1995]

* Wrote maxstatecom() to set the MaxState value of an object.

* Wrote linkcom() to link two objects together (not a command yet).

* Changed setcom() so that SET AC can be used to set a new armor
  value for an object without getting the Armor oflag confused.

* You can ban hosts from using the USERS/WHO command at login. Simply
  add the host to the data/banned_login file. This file works the same
  as banned_hosts.

[September 15, 1995]

* Removed the allup() function.

* Wrote the strip_char() function to strip a single character from a string.

* Fixed a crash bug in NOWISH.

                               ** VERSION 1.68 **

[September 21, 1995]

* Changed the way the MUD handles banned hosts and the banned login system.
  It now uses variables in the user record instead of adding characters into
  the hostname. Those users with the ability to see socket activity will see
  the messages stating if the incoming host is banned in any way.

[September 28, 1995]

* Changed showplayer() to show the level name in the level field with the 
  level number.

[October 7, 1995]

* The SYSLOG command is now paged.

[October 11, 1995]

* The WIZLIST command is now paged.

* Changed the SeeExtended Change messages to only show to people that can 
  see the players that are doing the change command.

[October 12, 1995]

* Made a macro called 'is_aliased' to make coding a little easier.

* WHOCOM and WHONCOM will now display an asterick if a player is aliased 
  instead of the large "[Out of His/Her Head]" message.

[October 19, 1995]

* Started to work on a climate system to enhance the weather system.

[October 25, 1995]

* Removed the EFLAGS and moved all the ones that were used to PFLAGS.

* Not really important, but reindent'd the code to something more my style.

[November 1, 1995]

* Wrote a program called DETECT to autodetect the machine arch and operating
  system type and create MACHINE.H based from it. When you compile the MUD
  on your machine, it will compile DETECT. If you ever move the MUD to 
  another machine, I suggest touching 'detect.c'.

  NOTE: See the November 30, 1995 (1st Comment) Entry!

[November 15, 1995]

* Changed the function that gets the idle time to update correctly while in
  a handler other then get_command.

* Changed the deathroom messages a little, depending where the person dies.

                               ** VERSION 1.70 **

[November 30, 1995]

* Created a new Makefile and wrote a script to autogenerate the dependencies.
  A note about this new script, you no longer need to mess with the DETECT
  program, this script compiles it and runs it automatically.

* Made a check to make sure that a Wizard cannot set the damage, strength or
  mana number too high or low.

* Changed the AUTOHEAL function to also replenish mana points.

[December 13, 1995]

* Wrote the Oracle utilities (OTELL, OUSERS, OADDR, OHELP).

[December 28, 1995]

* Wrote in game banning for users, hosts, and who/user checking at login.

* Started working on a Puff that can heal, say, shout, tell, and do actions.

[December 29, 1995]

* Finished the Puff code mentioned on December 28.

* Made Puff unclonable.
 
[January 4, 1996]

* Fixed a bug that told people the name of the person that summoned them,
  even if the person was invisible.

[January 8, 1996]

* Rewrote the handle_packet code. Hopefully it will help with some of the
  various telnet bugs that the MUD seems to have. NOTE: Causes errors with
  TinyFugue's autologin scripts. Code removed.

* MUD commands are now allowed while a player is writing mail by entering
  !<command> on a blank line.

[January 10, 1996]

* Added a NoPuff command for those people who don't like what has been done
  to her.

                               ** VERSION 1.80 **

[January 29, 1996]

* Finished the new spells system for the MUD. This system takes full 
  advantage over the mana system that was made when iDiRT was created.
  The original DIRT spells have been implemented, and improved and a
  few new spells have been installed as well. EFLAGS are once again in
  the system, this time for spells.

* Rewrote the forget system. Players will now only be able to ignore tells.
  Players are now alloted 10 players to forget, and will only be able to
  forget those users that are online.

[January 30, 1996]

* Rewrote most of the reboot handler. The output file is now in a binary
  format to make the reboot system run alot smoother and to make updating
  the output file much easier.

* Rewrote converse mode so that it's available again.

* Cleaned up the player record a little bit.

* Rewrote the help pages, and got all of the commands (that I know of)
  inside of the help database.

* Decided to include the Beta packet handler with the MUD in a seperate
  file under the src/utils/ directory as packet.c.

[January 31, 1996]

* Added in Dual Port code from Vita (by ErIC), modified it a little for
  iDiRT to use 2 different handle_packet's.

* Wrote puntall.

[February 2, 1996]

* Cloned mobiles will no longer give points to a player if a player kills
  one, and players will not lose points if the mobile was a clone.

[February 3, 1996]

* Fixed TYPO and WISH.

[February 8, 1996]

* Added in a new packet handler from Hastur, this should hopefully fix
  most, if not all of the telnet bugs that iDiRT has.

* Removed the Dual Port code from the MUD.

[February 10, 1996]

* Finished fixing all -Wall warnings (Linux gcc 2.5.8, no optimization)

[February 20, 1996]

* Wrote the duration spell handler. This allows certain spells to last a 
  set number of minutes.

[February 24, 1996]

* Wrote a zone (ruins) to allow players to get magic spells.

* Fixed a few various bugs.

* Added in comparecom() from a very early version of iDiRT. The function 
  was lost during the rewrite of the pre-1.30 code.

* Wrote a wearall command.

[February 28, 1996]

* Got rid of the database.c stuff and cleaned up condition.c.

[March 2, 1996]

* Rewrote the update code from scratch. The update code that I have 
  written is much more stable then the one written by Hykin. Object errors 
  should cease to exist now.

[March 3, 1996]

* Rewrote the syslog command completely. It no longer forks a process to 
  view the file that made syslog viewing quite slow. I wrote my own 
  internal text search engine and it seems to work quite well. I even wrote 
  in color highlighting for certain logs.

[April 16, 1996]

* Removed the `messages' datafile and bootstrap loader for it.

[April 18, 1996]

* The MUD now keeps track of the number of times that it has been linked.

[April 21, 1996]

* Fixed a bug in showplayer that dealt with the home location and cloned
  locations.

* Wrote a function to create a ratio for the number of times that a player
  has killed a mobile versus been killed.

* Wrote a function named `wearspecials()' to handle the specials for
  wearcom. Both `wearcom()' and `wearall()' call this function to check 
  for any specials involving an object being worn.

[April 23, 1996]

* Changed `viewcom()' so that anyone with the permission to run it may 
  see the last command of any player at the same level or below them. If
  the player is below their level, it will say that the last command is
  "Unavailable."

[April 25, 1996]

* Moved the version command into ver.c along with the need for LINKCOUNT.H.
  This should speed up compile time because ver.c is alot smaller then the
  parse.c source file.

* Moved the commands from wizard.c to god.c that were only for Gods.

[April 26, 1996]

* Fixed a crash bug in parse.c. It seems that the if() statement that
  checked for converse mode had a bug in it. When a player was aliasing
  a mobile it would crash upon the first command. This was due to a need
  to use the real_mynum variable, not mynum in the if() statement.

[May 2, 1996]

* A message can be given for the away command.

* Who/Whoncom will now autowrap the status messages after the title.

[May 3, 1996]

* Wrote zopen and zclose to handle compressed files.

* Did some cosmetic changes (yet again) to mkdata.c (generate).

* Wrote sayto. This command allows a person to direct a say.

[May 10, 1996]

* Combined who/whon into one function.

* Removed asmortal, seeing that nobody ever used this and it's useless.

[May 11, 1996]

* Started to rewrite the iDiRT Mailer from scratch. It will include a better
  input handler system, message forwarding, and a few more goodies.

[May 17, 1996]

* Finished the iDiRT Mailer 2.00. It took a little time because I ended up
  rewriting it twice. The new mailer has many features that makes it much
  easier to use, compared to the older mailer. Not all of the bugs have
  been worked out of it though. Hopefully there aren't many, and hopefully
  they won't cause crashes if there are any bugs.

* Moved the functions from commands.c that deal with communication into
  comm.c.

[May 18, 1996]

* Fixed a crash bug in tellcom(). It seems that a return is needed after
  the call to error().

* Wrote reboot_actions() to allow Gods to reload the actions file while
  the MUD is running so that a reboot/update doesn't have to be called.

* Moved the functions that deal with player/mobile stats into acct.c.

[May 23, 1996]

* Moved the functions that are like actions from commands.c into actions.c.

* Wrote levforcecom. 

[May 26, 1996]

* Changed how the Armor and Damage spells handle themselves. Instead of
  changing the player's damage/armor, the functions player_damage() and
  player_armor() check to see if a player is using one of the spells and
  accordingly adds onto their damage/armor.

[May 29, 1996]

* Fixed a crashbug in givecom(). It seems that there were more error()
  bugs like the one that was fixed in tellcom().

* Rewrote the tracecom() that originally came with the MUD and wrote in
  a trace handler to track objects/players/mobiles.

[May 30, 1996]

* Ripped out the Oracle utilities.

* Wrote JUDGE to check out your enemy.

* Implemented IFLAGS to handle flags for objects that will help in 
  casting spells.

[May 31, 1996]

* Made the code (once again) compile clean with a -Wall (Linux gcc 2.5.8,
  no optimizations).

[June 1, 1996]

* Made FROB a command that cannot be used from within the mailer. Also made
  FROB illegal to use as a force.

[June 2, 1996]

* Removed exec.c from the source code along with all calls to error(). The
  only function remaining in exec.c, do_tables(), has been moved to parse.c.

[June 3, 1996]

* Made the crash handler make sure that the player mailfiles get closed
  and flushed correctly. It also aborts any mail that a player is sending.

[June 6, 1996]

* Generate now reads a different configuration file with an all new syntax.
  Look at generate.conf in the data directory for an explanation of this
  file. The file that lists the zones still exists in its original place
  but has also been changed. That file now only contains the names of the
  zones. It has also been renamed from "files" to "Zonelist".

[June 7, 1996]

* Made the name of the MUD configurable so that certain texts don't have
  to be searched out and changed. Also made the prompt definable. These
  defines are in config.h.

[June 8, 1996]

* Update now stores a mobile's score which is part of certain quests and
  other assorted specials.

* Wrote com_handler() to handle all of the comlines (except anon/shout). 
  This replaces the wiz_handler() function. Also moved nolinecom() from
  wizard.c to comm.c.

  Usage for com_handler():

	com_handler (char *format, char *linename, int lvl, int flg);
	com_handler ("&+Y[1] %n: &*%t", "&+YWizard", LVL_WIZARD, SFL_NOWIZ);

  *format	= The text to send; %n=Sender's Name, %t=Text Entered by Sender.
		"&+Y[1] %n: &*%t"

  *linename	= The offical name of the communication line.
		"&+YWizard"

  lvl		= The minimum level a player must be to hear the comline.
		LVL_WIZARD

  flg		= The SFLAG that lets a player ignore this comline.
		SFL_NOWIZ

* Fixed a minor bug in update. It was looking at the number of zones, mobiles
  and objects including cloned objects, instead of just permenant ones. This
  has been fixed.

[June 9, 1996]

* Made NOCATCH a define to have the MUD not execute an AutoUpdate when a 
  crash occurs.

* Removed all of the calib_player() and calibme() calls from the code and
  replaced them with two calls to the functions. calib_player() is now only
  called during an interrupt to make sure that a player gets their level
  updated. calibme() is now only called during the loseme() function when
  a player is losing connection.

[June 10, 1996]

* Placed the #include for global.h in utils.c, and removed it from mud.c.
  (This is a note for those people that upgrade iDiRT without using the
  patches.)

* Zones and locations now alphabetize the zonenames.

[June 12, 1996]

* Viewcom now has a message if it can't find the input_handler.

[June 13, 1996]

* Eating now replenishes both mana and health.

[June 15, 1996]

* Fixed a minor bug in com_handler() that didn't let messages get to aliased
  mobiles.

* Modified send_g_msg() a little. It no longer has to loop through all of
  the mobiles on the MUD to see if they are aliased. When a player uses the 
  alias command it stores the number of the mobile/player that they are
  aliasing in cur_player->aliasto. This number is then used to reference
  the cloned mobile to send a message.

* Removed the MODE_COLOR flag from sendsys.c and removed it from the
  remaning function calls that used it.

[June 24, 1996]

* Fixed a bug that wasn't loading wizard zones after a reboot/update.

* The mudlog now calls on the local machine time, rather than using the
  global_clock variable from the MUD to get the current time.

[July 1, 1996]

* Last healall time and time until next healall is now displayed in time.

[July 9, 1996]

* Wrote a check_files() function to check bulletins.

* Snoop now outputs different text to let the person that is using snoop
  know the input and output that the person being snooped is entering and
  receiving.

[July 10, 1996]

* Completely revamped the colorlog routines. Wrote a new function called
  strtlookup(). This function is like tlookup, except it uses strstr()
  and returns the position of the beginning and end of the string that
  you are searching for.

* If COMPACT_LOG is defined then the syslog command doesn't log the name
  of the day to save space.

* The MUD will now catch a couple of ways that players cheat. If a mortal
  tries to pit a cloned object it will take away the value of the object
  divided by 2 from his/her score (or set their score to 0 if the object
  would give them a negative score). If a mortal tries to use a cloned
  weapon in a fight, it will remove it from them and log a message.

* The IDLE_WIZARD #define was removed completely now that I rewrote (and
  once again added) code to kick out idle players. Wizards that are idle
  for the IDLE_MAX limit plus one hour will be kicked off.

[July 11, 1996]

* Made the monitor system complete. Players that are listed in the monitor
  file will have all of their input logged to 'data/LOGS/playername'.

* If a player checks a title of another using title <player> it will no
  longer send out the message stating that the person changed the player's
  title.

* The TTY command no longer displays a user's idle time. It now shows the
  time they connected in the following format: MonthName DayNumber HH:MM:SS.

* Fixed a bug in TTY and SOCKET that let players check on mobiles.

* Wrote a function called usesocketcom(). This is called by typing 'usock'.
  This function provides a player with the Socket PFlag the ability to see
  how many sockets the MUD has allocated and which of the allocated sockets
  are in use.

* The check_title() function has been removed from change.c.

[July 17, 1996]

* Wrote a function called xfree() that is called by the macro FREE(). All
  calls to free() have been changed to FREE().

* The unveil command will now only let the defined MASTERUSER unveil to the
  Master User level.

[August 1, 1996]

* Revamped the ZOPEN system. It now will autocompress when generate runs
  using the compression program that is picked in generate.conf.

* Fixed a small bug in tellcom() dealing with SoundProof rooms.

[August 6, 1996]

* A new administrative command, NORUN, has been created. This command places
  the runners inside of limbo3, and any players that enter the game that are
  less then Wizard into limbo3. Once this has been toggled back, the players
  will be placed back at a random start location (start1 or start2).

* Made LOG_SNOOP a configurable option.

[August 12, 1996]

* OFlags have been changed to 96 allowable bits. IFlags have been moved
  to OFlags, under the definition of OMFL_NAME. This is to distinguish
  the difference between Magical Object flags, and regular Object flags.

* Cleaned up some of the SFlag handling in change.c and frob.c. Changed the
  call to xtstbit (p.p_sflags.l) to tst_bit (&p.p_sflags). This follows the
  correct 64-bit handling syntax and looks cleaner.
